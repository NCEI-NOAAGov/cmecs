This directory contains interim materials for changes to the CMECS Substrate Component developed by the CMECS Substrate Component Workgroup, an interagency team convened to review multiple issues with the component that had been identified by the CMECS user community since its publication in 2012. The workgroup held a series of virtual meetings and convened targeted discussions with smaller groups of subject matter experts to recommend improvements and make the Substrate Component easier to use and apply more consistently. These changes were approved by the CMECS Implementation Group on October 20, 2023. 

These interim materials are being made available to users who want to begin applying the new Substrate Component immediately. A workgroup report is being written and will be published as a NOAA Technical Memo. The updated Substrate Component units and framework will be incorporated into the authoritative CMECS Catalog file and released as CMECS Version 1.1.0.

Please contact the CMECS Implementation Group (ocm.cmecs-ig@noaa.gov) with any questions.

### CMECS Version 1.1.0 Substrate Component Interim Materials
- [CMECS_SCWG_Final_Units_Interim.pdf](CMECS_1.1.0/Interim Materials- Substrate Component Approved Changes/CMECS_SCWG_Final_Units_Interim.pdf) contains a thesaurus of the revised CMECS Substrate Component units with implementation guidance.

- [CMECS_SCWG_Final_Units.xlxs](CMECS_1.1.0/Interim Materials- Substrate Component Approved Changes/CMECS_SCWG_Final_Units.xlsx) workbook contains
  - a sheet showing side-by-side tables of the CMECS Version 1.0.0 Substrate Component units (as published in FGDC-STD-018-2012) and the CMECS Version 1.1.0 Substrate Component units for comparison.
  - a sheet of the CMECS Version 1.1.0 Substrate Component units and defintions in hierarchical order with implementation guidance.
  - a sheet of the CMECS Version 1.1.0 Modifers, which contain some substrate-related additions.
- An updated [Figure 7.2](CMECS_1.1.0/Interim Materials- Substrate Component Approved Changes/Final_Revised_Figure_7-2_Ternary_Diagram.docx) (FGDC-STD-018-2012) that reflects the CMECS Version 1.1.0 Substrate Component units.
