# CMECS Maintenence
This is the official repository for accessing versioned releases of the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS).

## Description
The Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS, FGDC-STD-018-2012) is a set of defined terms ("units") used to describe and classify marine ecological data which was developed as a US national scheme for classifying and integrating observational data collected in coastal, marine, and lacustrine environments. CMECS was published by the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in 2012. The CMECS framework arranges its units hierarchically or semi-heirarchically within domain-specific modules: the Biotic, Geoform, Substrate, and Water Column Components; and Aquatic and Biogeographic Settings. This framework emulates the spatial nesting concepts used in GIS software so that the CMECS units can be used to categorize and map observational data to model ecosystems.

##Accessing CMECS
The CMECS FGDC-STD-018-2012 document can be accessed from the NOAA Institutional Repository (https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/27552). Please cite as: FGDC. 2012. Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard. Marine and Coastal Spatial Data Subcommittee (Federal Geographic Data Committee). FGDC-STD-018–2012. 

More information about CMECS maintenence can be found on the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) CMECS webpage (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/coastal-marine-ecological-classification-standard).

CMECS technical guidance and examples of how to apply the standard can be found on the NOAA Integrated Ocean and Coastal Mapping (IOCM) team's CMECS webpage (https://iocm.noaa.gov/standards/cmecs-home.html). 

## Support
For questions about this repository please contact Kate Rose (kate.rose@noaa.gov).
For questions about using CMECS please contact the CMECS Implementation Group (ocm.cmecs-ig@noaa.gov). 

## Future Updates
CMECS follows a Dynamic Standard Process described at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/coastal-marine-ecological-classification-standard under the **Vocabulary Maintenence** section, along with instructions for proposing revisions to CMECS and a form for submitting proposals. 

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
