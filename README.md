# CMECS Vocabulary Maintenence

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git.ncei.noaa.gov/kate.rose/cmecs_vocabulary.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

- [ ] [Set up project integrations](https://git.ncei.noaa.gov/kate.rose/cmecs_vocabulary/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)
- [ ] [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
- [ ] [Automatically close issues from merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically)
- [ ] [Enable merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/)
- [ ] [Automatically merge when pipeline succeeds](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html)

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.

- [ ] [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html)
- [ ] [Analyze your code for known vulnerabilities with Static Application Security Testing(SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
- [ ] [Deploy to Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, or Amazon ECS using Auto Deploy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/requirements.html)
- [ ] [Use pull-based deployments for improved Kubernetes management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
- [ ] [Set up protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html)

## Description
The Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) is a catalog of terms and definitions used to describe and classify marine ecological data using a simple, standard format and common terminology. CMECS allows users to organize and interpret marine observational data using a collection of settings (aquatic and biogeographic) and components (biotic, water column, substrate, and geoform) in a semi-hierarchical framework.

This repo contains RDF/OWL of the original CMECS vocabulary published by the US Federal Geographic Data Committe (CMECS 2012), and each subsequent version. 

More information about CMECS vocabulary maintenence, including governance documents can be found at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/coastal-marine-ecological-classification-standard.
CMECS technical guidance and examples of how to apply the standard can be found at https://iocm.noaa.gov/standards/cmecs-home.html. 
## Usage
## Support
For questions about this repo please contact kate.rose@noaa.gov.
For questions about using CMECS and other resources, contact ocm.cmecs-ig@noaa.gov 

## Future Updates
CMECS follows a Dynamic Standard Process described at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/coastal-marine-ecological-classification-standard under the **Vocabulary Maintenence** section, along with instructions for proposing revisions to CMECS and a form for submitting proposals. 

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
