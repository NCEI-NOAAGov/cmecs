# The CMECS Catalog
The Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) Catalog is the authoritative collection of ecological units (terms + defintions) and unit relationships (the CMECS framework).

## Versions
MAJOR versions will be assigned for the first published release and for completely-reviewed and updated releases.

MINOR versions will be assigned for releases that include changes to one or many units, unit additions and deprecations, changes to the framework.

PATCH versions will be assigned to releases that include editorial corrections, new or revised guidance or other annotation information but DO NOT include changes to units or hierarchy.

## About CMECS
CMECS (FGDC-STD-018-2012) is collection of defined terms ("units") used to describe and classify marine ecological data. It is a national scheme for classifying and integrating observational data collected in coastal, marine, and lacustrine environments in U.S. waters. CMECS was published by the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in 2012. The CMECS framework arranges its units hierarchically or semi-heirarchically within domain-specific modules: the Biotic, Geoform, Substrate, and Water Column Components; and Aquatic and Biogeographic Settings. This framework emulates the spatial nesting concepts used in GIS software so that the CMECS units can be used to categorize and map observational data to model ecosystems.

## The CMECS Document 
The CMECS FGDC-STD-018-2012 document contains the CMECS unit terms and defintions (as of the time of publication) along with scientific context and rationale, implementation guidance, examples and illustrations. This document is the source for the content in the CMECS Catalog, Version 1.0.0. *All mentions of page numbers, section numbers, figures, and tables in the CMECS Catalog are references to the CMECS FGDC-STD-018-2012 document, unless otherwise noted.*

## Maintaining CMECS and Proposing Changes
CMECS follows a Dynamic Standard Process to review and adopt changes that are proposed by the CMECS user community when necessary. More information about CMECS maintenence can be found on the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) CMECS webpage (https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/coastal-marine-ecological-classification-standard) under the **Vocabulary Maintenence** section, along with instructions for proposing revisions to CMECS and a form for submitting proposals.
