BC,Biotic Class,4,Aquatic Vegetation Bed,394,"This class includes subtidal or intertidal bottoms and any other areas characterized by a dominant cover of rooted vascular plants, attached macroalgae, or mosses, which are usually submersed in the water column or floating on the surface. They may be exposed during low tides. Non-rooted floating vegetation and free floating macroalgae are included with the Planktonic Biota Biotic Setting under the Floating/Suspended Plants and Macroalgae Subclass."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Algal Particles,464,"Areas dominated by live drifting or floating macroalgae, or macroalgal pieces. They do not form rafts, but their distribution in the water column is at a density that can be clearly observed with the human eye."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Algal Rafts,463,"Thick mats composed of macroalgae that either float on the surface or are submerged in the water column. Some species primarily float (e.g., Kelp Rafts, Rockweed Rafts, and <i>Sargassum</i> Rafts), while others may both float and sink (e.g., <i>Gracilaria</i> Rafts and <i>Ulva</i> Rafts)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Amphipod Aggregation,439,"Water parcels in which amphipods (laterally compressed or stick-like, elongated, generally small crustaceans) aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Aquatic Vascular Vegetation,434,"Aquatic vascular vegetation beds dominated by submerged, rooted, vascular species (such as seagrasses, Figure 8.15) or submerged or rooted floating freshwater tidal vascular vegetation (such as hornworts [<i>Ceratophyllum</i> spp.] or naiads [<i>Najas</i> spp.]).<br/><br/>Note: Nomenclatural standards and punctuation for vegetated biotic communities are taken directly from FGDC-STD-005-2008. Strata are separated by a ""/"" (i.e., tree/shrub/herbaceous). Hyphens between species names indicate that they are in the same strata. Parentheses indicate that the species is important in defining the association, but may not be in every observation of the association. The name of the FGDC-STD-005-2008 Class is always used at the end of the association name. The epithet, ""[Provisional]"" is used when the type has been identified, but not yet formally incorporated into FGDC-STD-005-2008."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Anemones,507,"Hard substrate areas dominated by attached anemones (coelenterates which secure themselves to a hard substrate with a pedal disc). These assemblages are common in certain rocky, coastal areas."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Basket Stars,1210,"Hard or mixed substrate areas characterized by brushy, many-armed echinoderms known as basket stars. Basket stars and brittle stars (see below) are both members of the class Ophiuroidea, but the arms of basket stars bifurcate many times to form a large complex that is reminiscent of a basket. Basket stars are usually larger than brittle stars, and maintain an upright form, generally clinging to hard substrate or solid objects using their bifurcated arms, which also function in suspension feeding."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Brachiopods,1211,"Areas dominated by brachiopods, a phylum of animals with two shells, a stalk-like peduncle, and a tentacular, ciliated feeding organ. Brachiopods resemble clams, but are not mollusks. In some species, the peduncle is used to attach the animal to hard substrate, or one of the valves is cemented to the substrate. In other species, the peduncle and the valves are adapted to burrowing in soft sediment (see Burrowing Brachiopods, below). Brachiopods may occur in very high densities in some areas and are common on the U.S. west coast. Certain species can be identified by the wide gape between their shells when they are feeding, but not all species exhibit this wide gape. Most Brachiopods feed on plankton or on detritus."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Bryozoans,509,"Areas dominated by abundant or structurally complex, attached bryozoan communities that are may be habitat-forming. These colonial filter-feeding animals have a protective chinitous or calcareous covering that adds structural support. They may occur on hard substrates as flat encrusting growths, as feathery branched structures, as complex calcareous shapes, as fouling communities, and in other forms. Certain species of bryozoans may create extensive habitats."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Corals,510,"Subtidal (and deeper) substrates that are dominated by non-reef-forming corals. These include hexacorals such as black corals (Order Antipatheria) and gold corals (Order Zoanthidea, family Gerardiidae). All octocorals are non-reef forming, including soft corals and gorgonian sea fans and sea whips (Order Alcyonacea). Also in this group, bamboo corals are generally larger, erect, tree-shaped branching octocoral forms (with an articulated, bamboo-like skeleton) that are common in the deep sea. None of the octocorals produce the calcium carbonate structures associated with coral reefs, but octocorals can form important habitat areas, particularly in the deep sea, where large communities may cover significant area. Most species require a hard substrate for attachment, which may range from bedrock to a single pebble. Octocorals in the order Pennatulacea (sea pens, sea pansies, and sea feathers) are in general specialized for life on soft substrates, and are addressed in the Soft Sediment Fauna subclass."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Crinoids,511,"Assemblages on hard or mixed substrates that are dominated by either attached, stalked crinoids (or ""sea lilies"") or motile (but often stationary, see Barnes 1980), comatulid (or ""feather stars""). These animals are common in the deep sea and in other areas. Crinoids are a Class of echinoderm characterized (in general) by a stalk that supports the body, mouth, and arms of the animal. The branching arms are equipped with ciliated grooves that carry food items to the central, upward-facing mouth."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Attached Fauna,425,"Areas characterized by rock substrates, gravel substrates, other hard substrates, or mixed substrates that are dominated by fauna which maintain contact with the substrate surface, including firmly attached, crawling, resting, interstitial, or clinging fauna. Fauna may be found on, between, or under rocks or other hard substrates or substrate mixes. These fauna use pedal discs, cement, byssal threads, feet, claws, appendages, spines, suction, negative density, or other means to stay in contact with the (generally) hard substrate, and may or may not be capable of slow movement over the substrate. However, these fauna are not able to achieve speeds sufficient to move beyond the unit boundary within one day. Many attached fauna are suspension feeders and feed from the water column. Other attached fauna are benthic feeders, including herbivores, predators, detritivores, and omnivores. Within Attached Fauna, the Biotic Group is identified as the biota making up the greatest percent cover on the hard attachment surface within the classified area. Biota present at lesser percent cover values within the classified area may be identified as Co-occurring Elements (See Section 10.6.2) or (if not a CMECS Biotic Group) Associated Taxa (See Section 10.3.1)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Holothurians,1216,"Areas where the epifaunal community is dominated by sessile or slow-moving holothurians (sea cucumbers) on hard or mixed substrates. Holothurians living on hard substrate may attach firmly, or may be capable of movement over the substrate. Many forms are adapted to feeding by moving their sticky tentacles over the substrate; other forms are suspension-feeders."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Hydroids,513,"Areas dominated by mounds or mats of hydroids that are attached to a hard substrate. Hydroids are colonies of individual cylindrical polyps arranged in a branching structure, as a furry or brushy covering, or in other forms. Polyps are specialized for support, reproduction, and defense, and are armed with nematocysts (stinging capsules in specialized cells). Hydroids are the benthic life stage of planktonic jellyfish medusae, and most are predators on small life forms. Hydroid mounds or mats may form very dense assemblages."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Mussels,515,"Areas dominated by dense accumulations of mussels attached to a substrate other than conspecifics. This group includes associated faunal communities and predators on mussels (e.g., starfish), which may be highly conspicuous. Areas where mussels have constructed substrate are classified as Mussel Reef. Areas where mussels are not attached to a hard substrate are classified as Soft Sediment Fauna, Mussel Bed."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Oysters,516,Areas dominated by fauna that consists of accumulations of oysters attached to a substrate other than conspecifics. Areas where oysters have constructed substrate are classified as Oyster Reef (see above). Areas where oysters are not attached to the substrate are classified as Soft Sediment Oyster Bed.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Sea Urchins,1219,"Hard or mixed substrate areas dominated by mobile sea urchins. Many sea urchins are omnivorous, consuming algae, debris, sessile invertebrates, and other foods. In some situations, sea urchins will occur in great numbers, clearly constituting the dominant Biotic Group. These fauna may be associated with another Biotic Group (upon which they are feeding) and may be considered as Co-occurring Elements if the ""forage"" group occurs in greater percent cover, or dominates biomass."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Sponges,517,"Hard or mixed substrate areas that are dominated by sponges and their associated communities, e.g., where non-reef building sponge species grow attached to hard substrate or are nestled among hard substrate, or where reef-building sponges grow on hard substrates in densities that are not judged sufficient to constitute a reef. Most sponge species do not have fused silica spicules, and so do not create lasting skeletons that build reefs. Nonetheless, these more fibrous and ephemeral sponges provide seafloor relief and excellent habitat for other fauna, including many commensal species that live within the tissues of the sponge."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Starfish,1218,"Hard or mixed substrate areas in which starfish (sea stars) occur in large aggregations and clearly dominate the biota. Practitioners should note that, in most cases, starfish are predators on another Biotic Group (e.g., Attached Mussels) which (as the forage base) would normally constitute the dominant percent cover. In those cases, Starfish would be described as a Co-occurring Element, e.g., ""Biotic Group: Attached <i>Mytilus edulis</i> with Co-occurring Element: Attached <i>Asterias rubens""</i>. The Attached Starfish biotic group is intended to describe areas where starfish constitute the dominant life form in percent cover, not areas with occasional or scattered starfish."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Tube-Building Fauna,1280,"Hard substrate areas with a percent cover dominated by tube builders, including annelids, phoronids, sipunculids, crustaceans, gastropods, pogonophorans, echiurans, priapulids, and other phyla. These animals construct chitinous, leathery, calcareous, sandy, mucus, or other types of tubes that are cemented or otherwise attached to hard substrate, and can occur in very high densities. If the tubes are built from a more permanent material (e.g., calcium carbonate) and occur in densities sufficient to construct substrate, these areas may be classified as Reef Biota."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Attached Tunicates,518,"Areas dominated by attached members of the subphylum Tunicata, known as tunicates, ascidians, or sea squirts. Tunicates are bag-like filter feeders with an incurrent and an excurrent siphon. In some areas they reach high abundances. One species (<i>Didemnum</i>, see Figure 8.10) is a rapid invasive that blankets large areas, excludes other fauna, and has invaded many countries around the world, including the United States, on both the East and West coasts."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Bacterial Decay,550,"Areas dominated by colonies of bacterial decomposers and other decay organisms that are observed covering and rotting larger organic matter (such as macroalgal debris, fish kills, or similar large organic inputs). See Figure 8.13 for an example of bacterial decay."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Bacterial Mat/Film,549,Areas dominated by colonies of bacterial decomposers and other decay organisms. These colonies can range in appearance from delicate and filamentous to a dense mass that may blanket the sediment surface. See Figure 8.12 for an example of a bacterial mat.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Barnacles,508,"Areas dominated by barnacles (small filter-feeding crustaceans in a protective shell that is attached to hard substrate) and associated fauna (e.g., the snail, <i>Littorina</i>; see Figure 8.9)."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Benthic Macroalgae,433,"Aquatic beds dominated by macroalgae attached to the substrate, such as kelp (Figure 8.14), intertidal fucoids, and calcareous algae. Macroalgal communities can exist at all depths within the photic zone, on diverse substrates, and across a range of energy and water chemistry regimes. In the CMECS framework, macroalgae that dominate the benthic environment and form a vegetated cover fall within this subclass. Macroalgal communities (typically coralline/crustose algae) that build substrate in a reef setting are categorized in the BC Reef Biota Class instead.<br/><br/>Many macroalgal types and communities have low temporal persistence and can bloom and die-back within short periods. This aspect of macroalgae is reflected with the temporal persistence modifier, which allows further description of the units in this subclass.<br/><br/>While many researchers organize macroalgae based on their pigmentation, CMECS takes a growth morphology approach to defining benthic algal biotic groups. This decision was driven by the fact that macroalgal assemblages often include a variety of co-existing algal species, making delineations of individual species difficult. This approach also captures the influence that the algal growth structure has in shaping the local environment—by providing shelter, shade, and detrital material to an area, which is important to associated fauna.<br/><br/>The Biotic Group level of classification here is a modification of the ""Littler functional-form model"" for marine macroalgae, as described by Littler, Littler, and Taylor (1983) and promoted by Lobban and Harrison (1997). The Littler functional form groups are the sheet group, filamentous group, coarsely branched group, thick leathery group, jointed calcareous group, and crustose group. Littler, Littler, and Taylor (1983) discuss the morphological, metabolic, and ecological significance of each group, and they point out that these groups are best considered as recognizable points along a continuum (rather than as discrete bins). Biotic Groups and Communities defined by macroalgae generally also include a diversity of associated fauna, including many that consume macroalgae (e.g., sea urchins and mollusks); these may be characterized as Modifiers: Associated Taxa, or Co-occurring Elements."
BC,Biotic Setting,91,Benthic/Attached Biota,389,"This biotic setting describes areas where biota lives on, in, or in close association with the seafloor or other substrates (e.g., pilings, buoys), extending down into the sediment to include the sub-surface layers of substrate that contain multi-cellular life. As a rule, Benthic/Attached Biota units are characterized by the various life histories and taxonomic characteristics of the dominant life forms."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Brachiopod Bed,1220,"Soft-sediment areas dominated by burrowing, clam-like brachiopods, a phylum of animals with two shells, a stalk-like peduncle, and a tentacular, ciliated feeding organ. In soft sediment dwelling species, the peduncle and the valves are adapted to burrowing. In other brachiopod species, the animal is adapted to attach to hard substrate (see Attached Brachiopods, above). Most brachiopods feed on plankton or on detritus. Brachiopods may occur in very high densities in some soft sediment areas, including intertidal areas (particularly on the west coast of the United States)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Brackish Marsh,568,"Marshes dominated by species with a wide range of salinity tolerance. Depending on the salinity levels (0.5-30), more or less salt-intolerant species may be present. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Brackish Tidal Forest/Woodland,578,Tidal areas dominated by tree species that are greater than 6 meters tall and have a range of salt tolerance. Salinities may range from 0.5-30.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Brackish Tidal Scrub-Shrub,574,Tidal areas dominated by shrub or immature tree species that are less than 6 meters tall and have a range of salt tolerance. Salinity may range from 0.5-30 (PSS).
BC,Biotic Group,6,Branching Coral Reef,492,"Reefs in shallow or mesophotic situations dominated by branching corals (includes arborescent, arboreal, digitate, corymbose, ramose, and elkhorn corals) that grow in a tree-like shape and have numerous branches, some with secondary branches. This group includes both fragile, branching corals and more robust, branching corals that have exceptionally thick and sturdy antler-like branches (such as elkhorn corals). See Figure 8.2 for an example of the branching coral growth form."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Brittle Stars on Hard or Mixed Substrates,1212,"Assemblages dominated by crawling, epifaunal, crevice-dwelling brittle stars, often living on, between, or under rocks. Brittle stars (together with basket stars) are Ophiuroids, a relatively mobile class of echinoderms. Some brittle star species are specialized for life on or among rocks and other hard substrates, others are specialized for infaunal burrowing, and some species may be generalists, found in a variety of substrates, and utilizing a variety of feeding methods."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Burrowing Anemones,520,"Areas dominated by anemones (solitary coelenterates) that use their pedal disc to burrow in soft substrates. Many species are characterized by a whorl of tentacles at the sediment surface; when disturbed, the animal may very rapidly retract its tentacles into a burrow. These anemones occur at a range of densities, which requires sampling gear with an appropriate resolution and observational footprint (e.g., video transects or plan-view still photographs)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Burrowing Urchins,542,"Assemblages dominated by burrowing, ""irregular"" echinoids (e.g., burrowing urchins, heart urchins). These flattened urchins typically live underneath the sediment surface and feed on mud or on particles of detritus."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Calcareous Algal Bed,558,"Areas dominated by calcareous algae that incorporate calcium carbonate into their tissues, support their own weight, and have an upright growth form. Calcareous algae can form carpets on the bottom, and—as they decay—the calcareous skeletons remain behind, occasionally forming loose accumulations on the bottom resembling chips. Calcareous algae that occur in a reef setting are included in the Colonized Shallow and Mesophotic Reef biotic group."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Canopy-Forming Algal Bed,559,"Areas dominated by canopy-forming algae that have complex growth forms with holdfasts and well-defined stipes and blades. Canopy forming algae are distinguished from other types of macroalgae, in that they often reach heights of several meters or greater. Their presence alters water energy patterns and provides shelter for other marine organisms. Kelp beds are an example of canopy forming algal communities (Figure 8.14)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Cephalochordates,1284,"Soft-sediment areas (typically sandy) that are dominated by the rapidly burrowing, fish-like <i>Amphioxus</i>, or by other similar Genera of the subphylum Cephalochordata, a group of animals with characteristics of both vertebrates and invertebrates. These small (typically 2 - 15 centimeters in length) slender animals live buried just under the surface of sandy sediments. They feed on plankton or detritus that is strained from the water with a specialized feeding apparatus. <i>Amphioxus</i> and the related Genera have a worldwide distribution, and may occur in very high densities in some areas."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Chaetognath Aggregation,457,"Water parcels in which chaetognaths aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton. Chaetognaths are small, fish-shaped worms with large ""teeth,"" and they are ferocious predators. They are commonly known as Arrow Worms."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Chitons,1281,"Areas dominated by attached chitons, gastropod-like mollusks with eight calcareous dorsal plates (valves), a broad foot for attachment to hard substrates, and a scraping radula for feeding. Several species can reach high abundances on intertidal or subtidal rocks. Some chitons will create a depression in rock substrate for improved protection; however, they are classified here as Chitons, rather than above as Mineral Boring Fauna."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Chlorophyte Aggregation,475,Waters dominated by Chlorophytes. This group is known to aggregate at frontal zones and under ice pack.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Chlorophyte Bloom,476,"Surface waters where rapid growth and very high densities of chlorophytes occur, particularly under quiescent conditions when nutrients are in excess."

BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Chlorophyte Phytoplankton,474,"Areas dominated by Chlorophytes (green algae that are unicellular, flagellated, and sometimes colonial phytoplankton), occurring more predominantly in the tropics."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Chrysophyte Aggregation,468,"Waters dominated by chrysophytes; these cells can aggregate via mucus excretions that bind single cells into colonies, often combined with mineral particles and bacterial communities. Chrysophytes occur in coastal waters where nutrients and light are sufficient."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Chrysophyte Bloom,469,Surface waters where rapid growth and very high densities of chrysophytes occur. These organisms form brown tide blooms that are common in coastal waters and estuaries and often damage seagrass beds (by shading).They also may exhibit toxicity to grazers and filter feeders.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Chrysophyte Maximum Layer,470,Relatively thin layer dominated by chrysophytes at depth in the water column; some chrysophytes are flagellated and can adjust their position in the water column. These and other plankton form maxima at depths where nutrients are in optimal concentrations.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Chrysophyte Phytoplankton,411,"Waters dominated by Chrysophyte Phytoplankton, single-celled algae found mostly in freshwater (although several orders occur in brackish and salt water). The pigment fucoxanthin gives them a yellow or brown color, and there are a variety of forms of the so-called ""golden algae,"" including plasmoid, amoeba-like, flagellated, naked, and silicious."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Clam Bed,524,"Areas where either: (a) living clams, siphons, or siphon holes are the dominant surface feature, or; (b) clams dominate the faunal biomass. Siphons or shells may (or may not) be visible from above the sediment surface. The Clam Bed biotic group includes clams of all sizes; clam size can be specified using the Invertebrate Community Organism Size Modifiers: Meiofauna (dominants < 0.5 millimeter), Small Macrofauna (dominants > 0.5 millimeter to 2 millimeters), Large Macrofauna (dominants > 2 millimeters to 1 centimeter), Megafauna (dominants > 1 centimeter to 3 centimeters), Large Megafauna (dominants > 3 centimeters), with all measurements in the smallest dimension (e.g., the smallest shell width for most clams)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Coccolithophore Aggregation,471,"Waters dominated by coccolithophores. This group is distributed throughout the oceans and tends to have high light requirements, often aggregating in the upper water column and surface layer."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Coccolithophore Bloom,472,Surface waters where rapid growth and very high densities of coccolithophores occur. These organisms form enormous blooms in the coastal and offshore oceans. Blooms may be linked to upwelling events.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Coccolithophore Maximum Layer,473,"Relatively thin layer dominated by coccolithophores at depth in the water column where nutrients are optimal. Coccolithophores are not generally found at depth; however, when surface nutrients are depleted and the water column is clear, some instances of a deeper maximum in the epipelagic layer have been noted."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Coccolithophore Phytoplankton,412,"Coccolithophores are small phytoplankters, predominantly marine, which produce plates of calcium carbonate as shells."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Colonized Deepwater/Coldwater Reef,491,"Areas dominated by deepwater reefs where live reef building hard corals are present, but not clearly dominant. Cover is dominated by non-reef-forming biota, including black corals, gold corals, gorgonians, sponges, and other sedentary or attached macro-invertebrates. If no living reef-forming corals are present, then the biotic class is Faunal Bed."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Colonized Shallow/Mesophotic Reef,501,"Tropical coral reef substrate where live reef building corals are present, but not clearly dominant. Cover is dominated by non-reef-forming corals (such as soft corals, gorgonians [e.g., sea fans and sea whips], and sea pansies), sponges, other sedentary or attached macro-invertebrates, occasional seagrasses, macroalgae, echinoderms, and other reef associates. Reef-building, hard corals are present, but not clearly dominant. If no living coral is present, then the biotic class if Faunal Bed."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Columnar Coral Reef,493,Areas dominated by columnar corals that emerge from a massive base in a pillar form and do not branch. They are commonly found in mild water flow at mid-depth water levels.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Copepod Aggregation,440,Water parcels in which copepods aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton. Planktonic copepods are thought to be among the most abundant multi-cellular animals on Earth. Most planktonic copepods use their large antennae to move in a series of jerky motions.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Coral Larval Aggregation,445,"Water parcels in which coral larvae aggregate post-spawning, with no evidence of a recent spawning event, and they are the dominant form of zooplankton."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Coral Meroplankton,400,Water parcels in which coral larval life-history stages are the perceived dominant feature. This generally occurs during and after synchronous spawning events in reef areas with high coral biomass.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Coral Spawning and Larval Aggregation,444,"Water parcels in which coral gametes and larvae are aggregated during and after simultaneous spawning (often in astronomical numbers). In events that involve synchronous spawning of multiple species of corals, the concept of species-specific or group-specific biotic communities (below) may not apply, and the feature is identified at the biotic group level."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Coralline/Crustose Algal Bed,560,"Areas dominated by coralline or crustose algae that incorporate calcium carbonate into their tissues and form crusts on the substrate in many marine environments. Coralline algae can be attached or unattached (as in the rhodoliths that form nodules, which can occur in loose accumulations on the substrate). In the attached algae, the thalli are fixed to the substrate. Coralline/Crustose algae that occur in a reef setting are included in the Colonized Shallow and Mesophotic Reef biotic group."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Crustacean Holoplankton,398,Water parcels in which crustacean holoplankton are the perceived dominant feature. Crustaceans constitute the vast bulk of zooplankton in many areas of the ocean.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Crustacean Meroplankton,399,"Water parcels in which crustacean meroplankton are the perceived dominant feature. These zooplankters typically go through several very different larval stages, and can be difficult to identify."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Cryptophyte Aggregation,477,Waters dominated by aggregations of cryptophytes. Cryptophytes aggregate in waters where nutrient concentrations are seasonally in low supply and nutritional needs can be met by consuming bacteria.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Cryptophyte Bloom,478,Surface waters where rapid growth and very high densities of cryptophytes occur. Blooms are generally not toxic and can form in coastal and estuarine waters.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Cryptophyte Maximum Layer,479,Relatively thin layer dominated by cryptophytes at depth in the water column. Motility allows the group to avoid predation and to optimize their heterotrophic grazing.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Cryptophyte Phytoplankton,413,"Waters dominated by cryptophytes, a small—but diverse—group of unicellular algae that occur in fresh and salt water. Some species are mixotrophic and are able to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Ctenophore Aggregation,449,"Water parcels in which ctenophores aggregate so as to constitute the dominant form of zooplankton. Ctenophores are small, gelatinous, ciliated animals with a generally rounded or lobed form. Two retractable feeding tentacles may also be present."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Cyanophyte Aggregation,480,"Waters dominated by cyanophytes, which can aggregate under appropriate conditions in both coastal and open ocean environments. Those with nitrogen-fixing capability have a competitive advantage in nitrogen-poor environments, and coccoid cyanophytes are often dominant in oligotrophic tropical oceans."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Cyanophyte Bloom,481,"Surface waters where rapid growth and very high densities of cyanophytes occur. Cyanophyte Blooms are increasingly common in coastal waters, and can be toxic."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Cyanophyte Maximum Layer,482,Relatively thin layer dominated by cyanophytes at depth in the water column. Cyanophytes can be found in a maximum layer where nutrients are sufficient (often at the base of the nutricline). They are often associated with an oxygen maximum layer due to their high rates of photosynthetic production.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Cyanophyte Phytoplankton,414,"Areas dominated by cyanophytes, blue-green algae that are photosynthetic bacteria. Some of these are nitrogen fixing, some form resting cysts, and they can exist singly or in colonies."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Decapod Larval Aggregation,442,"Water parcels in which crab, shrimp, and lobster larvae aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Deepwater/Coldwater Coral Reef Biota,420,"Areas dominated by biota closely associated with the structures and settings created by azooxanthellate (lacking symbiotic algae), deep-water, stony corals (Order Scleractinia) or stylasterid corals (Order Anthoathecatae; Family Stylasteridae). Biotic groups and communities for the Deepwater/Coldwater Coral Reef subclass recognize coral reef areas as structural settings that were constructed by the framework-forming corals. The living coral reef is characterized by the presence of live reef-forming corals, but may or may not be dominated by living corals; other fauna may in fact exceed the corals in percent cover.<br/><br/>The Deepwater/Coldwater Coral Reefs are separated into two Biotic Groups based on whether they are formed by stony corals or stylasterid corals. The growth forms of those corals and the reefs they create are structurally different. Biotic communities are characterized by the dominant species of framework-forming, deep-sea coral. For example, a Deepwater/Coldwater <i>Lophelia</i> Reef would be dominated by <i>Lophelia pertusa</i> coral, but may include other stony corals such as <i>Madrepora oculata, Enallopsammia rostrata, </i>or <i>Solenosmilia variabilis</i>."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Deepwater/Coldwater Stony Coral Reef,489,"Areas dominated by deepwater stony corals. There are 17 known species of deepwater, azooxanthellate, stony corals (Class: Anthozoa; Order: Scleractinia) that form larger, branching colonies and contribute to reef frameworks. Six of these are particularly widespread or important, and these are major contributors to the framework of their respective habitats. These species form branching colonies (generally less than 1 - 2 meters in size), and aggregations of these living colonies—and their immediately adjacent dead framework and rubble—are important habitats for numerous other sedentary and mobile species."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Deepwater/Coldwater Stylasterid Coral Reef,490,"Areas dominated by stylasterid corals. A number of stylasterid coral species (Class: Hydrozoa; Order: Anthoathecatae; Family: Stylasteridae) form smaller branching colonies that can dominate certain habitats, primarily in deeper, colder waters. Stylasterid coral reefs often predominate on oceanic islands, seamounts, and archipelagos (Cairns 1992)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Diatom Aggregation,483,"Waters dominated by diatoms that aggregate passively during blooms or via exudation of sticky polymers that act as glue to bind cells together. (Bacteria may play an important role in the binding process.) Diatom aggregations play an important role in the marine carbon budget, and since aggregations sink more rapidly than single cells, they transport carbon to lower waters and the benthos."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Diatom Bloom,484,"Surface waters where rapid growth and very high densities of diatoms occur. Diatoms are large cells and tend to have high nutrient requirements. Spring diatom blooms occur in many estuarine and coastal waters, as diatoms have low light requirements and are well adapted to the hydrologic period when turbid riverine inputs are highest. They have higher nutrient requirements than other groups and require silica, needed to produce frustules. Land runoff contains silica making the spring period ideal for formation of coastal diatom blooms. The rise of the bloom is important in initiating food webs of zooplankton and other grazers and the decay of the bloom is important in nutrient cycling, and potentially contributes to the later formation of hypoxic bottom water as organic material accumulates in the lower water column."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Diatom Maximum Layer,485,Relatively thin layer dominated by diatoms at depth in the water column. Layers of high diatom density generally form in the surface mixed layer and have also been found at deep subsurface maxima. These are associated with nutrient or temperature maxima.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Diatom Phytoplankton,415,"Waters dominated by Diatom Phytoplankton, single-cell algae that circulate passively or sink in the water column. This non-flagellated group possesses silica-based frustules that can form large and elaborate static appendages. They are considered desirable, high-quality food for grazers, supporting healthy food webs."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Dinoflagellate Aggregation,486,"Waters dominated by dinoflagellates that aggregate in coastal and marine waters throughout the world. Some evidence suggests that both heterotrophic and mixotrophic feeding adaptations supplement autotrophy, giving dinoflagellates a competitive advantage over other groups—especially during periods of low nutrient availability. Aggregations are responsible for bioluminescence, which may reduce predation by disrupting grazers and by triggering secondary predators that consume dinoflagellate predators (Latz et al. 2004)"
BC,Biotic Group,6,Dinoflagellate Bloom,487,"Surface waters where rapid growth and very high densities of dinoflagellates occur. These blooms have caused a number of problems in coastal waters because many species are toxic to consumers. Shellfish and fish can accumulate toxins and pass them on to higher trophic levels, including humans."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Dinoflagellate Maximum Layer,488,Relatively thin layer dominated by dinoflagellates at depth in the water column. Dinoflagellates migrate vertically through the water column to layers where nutrients and light are optimal for growth. Often the maxima can occur at the surface when nutrients are saturating throughout the water column. There is also evidence that migration is an adaptive strategy to avoid predation (Baek et al. 2011).
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Dinoflagellate Phytoplankton,416,"Areas dominated by flagellated phytoplankton that have some motility and can control their position in the water column to a degree, diurnally migrating from surface to bottom to maximize conditions for growth. This group has both photosynthetic and heterotrophic species, which play a large role in coastal and estuarine trophic dynamics. These phytoplankton also can form noxious and harmful blooms, including red tides that may be toxic to higher consumers and to humans. Their complex life cycle goes through many stages, which can include resting cysts that spend prolonged periods in the benthic sediments."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Diverse Colonizers,512,"Areas dominated by highly varied and diverse communities of mixed fauna that have attached to a biotic or abiotic hard substrate (which may be rock, cobble, oyster reef, non-living coral reefs, or other substrates). Common colonizing taxa include anemones, tunicates, barnacles, mollusks, hydroids, bryozoans, gorgonians, soft or leather corals, sponges, and/or other taxa. Diverse Colonizers on living coral reefs are included in the Colonized Shallow and Mesophotic Reef Biotic Group. Diverse Colonizers can be further described using the Invertebrate Community Organism Size Modifiers: Meiofauna (dominants < 0.5 millimeter), Small Macrofauna (dominants > 0.5 millimeter to 2 millimeters), Large Macrofauna (dominants > 2 millimeters to 1 centimeter), Megafauna (dominants > 1 centimeter to 3 centimeters), Large Megafauna (dominants > 3 centimeters), with all measurements in the smallest dimension (e.g., width or height) and not including the length of slender lateral projections (e.g., arms or tentacles). As with all biotic groups, this unit may be used when communities cannot be identified, as in ""Diverse Colonizers (Megafauna)"", which provides important information despite limitations of data, e.g., video information."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Diverse Soft Sediment Epifauna,527,"Highly varied and diverse communities of mixed fauna that are present on the surface of soft unconsolidated substrates. Common taxa include annelids, holothurians, ophiuroids, anemones, tunicates, mollusks, sea pansies, hydroids, bryozoans, sea urchins, sponges, echiuroids, priapulids, and many others. Diverse Fine Sediment Epifauna can be further described using the Invertebrate Community Organism Size Modifiers: Meiofauna (dominants < 0.5 millimeter), Small Macrofauna (dominants > 0.5 millimeter to 2 millimeters), Large Macrofauna (dominants > 2 millimeters to 1 centimeter), Megafauna (dominants > 1 centimeter to 3 centimeters), Large Megafauna (dominants > 3 centimeters), with all measurements in the smallest dimension (e.g., width or height) and not including the length of slender lateral projections (e.g., arms or tentacles). As with all Biotic Groups, this unit may be used when Communities cannot be identified, as in ""Diverse Soft Sediment Epifauna (Large Macrofauna), which provides important information despite limitations of data, e.g., video information."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Echinoderm Meroplankton,401,"Water parcels in which echinoderm larvae are the perceived dominant feature. Echinoderms go through distinctive larval stages, most of which are characterized by different series of ciliated bands that are arranged with bilateral symmetry. Each echinoderm group features different larval forms (e.g., pluteus larvae or bipinnaria larvae)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Echiurid Bed,528,"Soft-sediment areas dominated by unsegmented echiurids or ""spoon worms"" which are abundant on the U.S. west coast in both intertidal and subtidal habitats. This group also includes communities where U-shaped echiurid burrows constitute the dominant or characteristic faunal feature, even if all animals have retracted into their burrows and cannot be seen."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Egg Masses,1316,"Areas distinguished by egg masses, egg cases, or other lasting evidence of gametes or reproduction. Many burrowing or tube-dwelling polychaetes will produce egg masses that look like bags of mucus attached to the soft sediment seafloor. Gastropods also often produce distinctive egg cases."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Emergent Freshwater Tidal Moss,557,Emergent freshwater tidal marshes dominated by mosses.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Emergent Tidal Marsh,435,"Communities dominated by emergent, halophytic, herbaceous vegetation (with occasional woody forbs or shrubs) along low-wave-energy, intertidal areas of estuaries and rivers.<br/><br/>Biotic communities in this subclass are equivalent to National Vegetation Classification Associations of FGDC-STD-005-2008, and follow their naming conventions (FGDC 2008). However, FGDC-STD-005-2008 does not split marshes into ""herbaceous"" or ""scrub-shrub"" at their Group level. As a result, some of the names of FGDC-STD-005-2008 types (which correspond to the CMECS Emergent Wetland class) indicate that the biotic community is a ""Dwarf-shrubland."" These specific communities are dominated by woody forbs, which—while technically dwarf-shrubs—function more like herbaceous vegetation. These types were included in Emergent Tidal Marsh, because their total floristics and physiognomy indicate an herbaceous marsh setting.<br/><br/>Vegetation in this subclass is composed of emergent aquatic macrophytes, especially halophytic species—chiefly graminoids (such as rushes, reeds, grasses and sedges), shrubs, and other herbaceous species (such as broad-leaved emergent macrophytes, rooted floating-leaved and submergent species [aquatic vegetation], and macroscopic algae). The vegetation is usually arranged in distinct zones of parallel patterns, which occur in response to gradients of tidal flooding frequency and duration, water chemistry, or other disturbances.<br/><br/>Tides may expose mudflats that contain a sparse mix of pioneering forb and graminoid species. Salinity levels (which control many aspects of salt-marsh chemistry) vary depending on a complexity of factors, including frequency of inundation, rainfall, soil texture, freshwater influence, fossil salt deposits, and more. Salt marshes often grade into (or are intermixed with) scrub-shrub wetlands in higher areas. See Figure 8.16 for an example of an emergent tidal marsh."
BC,Biotic Class,4,Emergent Wetland,395,"Areas in this class are characterized by erect, rooted, herbaceous hydrophytes—excluding emergent mosses and lichens. This vegetation is present for most of the growing season in most years. These wetlands are usually dominated by perennial plants. This CMECS class is equivalent to the Emergent Wetland Class from FGDC-STD-004 (FGDC 1996b)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Encrusting Coral Reef,494,"Reefs or reef-like, rocky structures dominated by encrusting corals (also called crustose corals) that (a) cover the substrate in a sheet and (b) expand in diameter rather than height. Encrusting corals are highly tolerant of strong water currents, and they are frequently found on rocky shorelines lacking a beach. See Figure 8.3 for an example of the encrusting coral growth form."
BC,Biotic Class,4,Faunal Bed,391,"Seabeds dominated or characterized by a cover of animals that are closely associated with the bottom, including attached, clinging, sessile, infaunal, burrowing, laying, interstitial, and slow-moving animals, but not animals that have created substrate (Reef Biota). Unlike Reef Biota, Faunal Bed biota cannot (or are not sufficiently abundant to) construct identifiable substrate. ""Slow-moving"" animals included in the Faunal Bed class are defined as being incapable of moving outside the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. Faunal Bed organisms are aquatic, but they may be able to withstand periods of exposure to air.<br/><br/>Faunal Bed food webs may receive basic trophic inputs from benthic photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, plankton, allochthonous detritus and debris, or other sources. In nature, Faunal Bed habitats are often composed of complex mixes and associations of animals of different phyla, sizes, feeding strategies, and habits, and these areas can be difficult to classify. Faunal Bed classifications are determined in CMECS by greatest percent cover of fauna or faunal structures, or (particularly for infauna) by estimates of greatest biomass. The inherent complexity of these areas is addressed through Co-occurring Elements and Associated Taxa Modifiers (Sections 10.6.2 and 10.3.1).<br/><br/>In the photic zone, primary producers often constitute the greatest biotic percent cover of substrate, and so define the biotic group of an area (e.g., Filamentous Algal Bed, Microphytobenthos). Faunal Bed organisms, when present in these areas, are classified in CMECS as Co-occurring Elements, for example: ""Biotic Group: Coralline/Crustose Algal Bed with Co-occurring Element: <i>Strongylocentrotus purpurata</i>"".<br/><br/>In waters deeper than the photic zone, however, most Faunal Bed biotic groups and communities are defined by immobile or slow-moving suspension-feeders and detritivores that dominate percent cover or biomass, and create a distinct living environment for other fauna. Other Faunal Bed biotic groups and communities are defined by slow-moving grazers or predators (e.g., urchins, starfish), when these are the clearly dominant fauna. However, practitioners should attempt to identify a biotic group that is providing ""forage"" for these predatory or herbivorous species. If a ""forage"" biotope is present, it will often dominate percent cover, and practitioners should characterize the area accordingly as (for example): ""Biotic Community: Nassariid Bed with Co-occurring Element: <i>Pisaster</i>"". The Co-occurring Elements modifier (see Section 10.6.2) is used to describe areas where any two (or more) biotic groups, biotic communities, or other biotic classification units described in CMECS occur simultaneously. In these cases, the classification units exist together, as a mix, in a single location, and the non-dominant units are termed Co-occurring Elements. Further local research may indicate that the mix of biotic groups and co-occurring elements is, in fact, a repeatable unit that should be designated as a single defined biotic group or biotope.<br/><br/>Other common animals in seafloor environments include opportunistic predators or herbivores that are capable of moving outside the bounds of the classification unit within one day, such as portunid crabs, cancrid crabs, horseshoe crabs, cephalopods, other mobile benthic crustaceans, fishes, and other nekton. These animals actively move over the seafloor searching for prey, and are defined in CMECS as Associated Taxa (see Section 10.3.1).<br/><br/>As in other BC classes, practitioners may apply Genus and/or species names to define local biotic communities that are not listed in the current version of CMECS. In these cases, observations in the field must verify that these new biotic communities are predictable and repeating aggregations or assemblages of dominant or characteristic species. These names should be submitted as part of the CMECS Dynamic Content St"
BC,Biotic Group,6,Fecal Mounds,1317,"Areas distinguished by large fecal mounds or castings. These features are characteristic of larger deposit-feeding polychaetes and other mud-ingesting fauna. Mounds or castings are not always present even when these fauna are abundant, particularly when water movements (currents, waves) are sufficient to remove the deposits."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Filamentous Algal Bed,561,"Areas dominated by filamentous algae that have a growth form consisting of fine filaments or strands with no blades or stipes. Filaments may branch, but they lack complex structures. The strands are undifferentiated (with a growth axis in one direction). Filamentous algae can form dense mats."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Films and Strands,417,"Aggregations of microbes in a very thin layer (millimeters or less) on the water's surface or at a discontinuity layer within the water column. The air-water interface is a site of intense biological activity due to the abundance of light, oxygen and energy. The density gradients and discontinuity at the surface of the water column or at fronts and discontinuities within the water column are ideal for the aggregation of microbes in films covering large areas and strands that follow the movements of water currents (Cunliffe and Murrell 2009). The concentration of microbes creates numerous niches for feeding by higher trophic levels and for the processing of biogenic and inorganic compounds that are important to marine chemistry, including controlling carbon, nitrogen and sulfur redox processes (Hansel and Francis 2006). The film created by microbial concentration also creates a biological barrier that can either facilitate or impede transgression of materials across the air-water interface or other layer."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Fish Larval Aggregation,448,Water parcels in which fish larvae aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Fish Meroplankton,402,"Water parcels in which fish meroplankton are the perceived dominant feature. Fish go through several larval stages as they progress from embryo to juvenile. Unlike many phyla, most of these stages do bear some resemblance to the adult (they are fish-like); nonetheless, the taxonomy of fish larvae is a specialized skill."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Fish Spawning and Larval Aggregation,447,"Water parcels in which fish gametes and larvae are aggregated (often in large numbers) after simultaneous spawning, and are the dominant form of zooplankton."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Floating/Suspended Freshwater and Brackish Vegetation,465,Areas dominated by freshwater and brackish vascular vegetation that is floating on the surface or suspended in the water column.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Floating/Suspended Macroalgae,409,Areas dominated by macroalgae species that are floating on the surface or suspended freely in the water column.
BC,Biotic Class,4,Floating/Suspended Microbes,388,Aggregations of microbes that are floating or suspended in the water column and not attached to the bottom or to any benthic substrate.
BC,Biotic Class,4,Floating/Suspended Plants and Macroalgae,386,"This class includes areas dominated by vascular plants, detached plant parts, or macroalgae that are floating on the surface or are suspended in the water column—that is, plants and macroalgae that are not rooted or attached to the bottom."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Floating/Suspended Vascular Vegetation,410,"Areas dominated by vascular vegetation that is floating on the surface or suspended freely in the water column. This subclass is limited to freshwater and brackish species. (There are no known marine, floating or suspended vascular, plant species.) Vascular vegetation that is floating on the surface, but rooted in the substrate is included in the Aquatic Vegetation Bed Class."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Foliose Coral Reef,495,Areas dominated by foliose corals that have a vase-like structure and whorl-like growth pattern similar to the open petals of a flower. The structure of these corals provides shelter for fish and invertebrate species. See Figure 8.4 for an example of the foliose coral growth form.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Foraminiferan Aggregation,455,Water parcels in which these numerous protists aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton. Most planktonic foraminifera are amoeboids that live in a 1 millimeter to 2 millimeters calcium carbonate test that is composed of several growth chambers. Amoeboid pseudopods extend through holes in the test.
BC,Biotic Class,4,Forested Wetland,397,"Areas in this class are characterized by woody vegetation that is generally 6 meters or taller. This CMECS class is equivalent to the Forested Wetland Class of FGDC-STD-004 (FGDC 1996b and the Forest/Woodland Class of FGDC-STD-005-2008); however, the palustrine and non-tidal riverine portions of the FGDC-STD-004 class are beyond the scope of CMECS."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Freshwater and Brackish Tidal Aquatic Vegetation,566,"Tidal aquatic vegetation beds dominated by submerged, rooted, vascular species that have limited (or no) salt tolerance. Some species, such as <i>Ruppia maritima</i>, can have a wide range of salt tolerance, and are included in this group when occurring in low salt environments or with other salt intolerant species that indicate low salt environments."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Freshwater Irregularly Flooded Tidal Lichen Zone,553,"Tidal areas that are irregularly flooded (less often than daily) by tidal or non-tidal floods. Areas are generally characterized by lichen species that require moist or damp substrates. This zone corresponds to the Fluvial Mesic and Fluvial Xeric Zones described by Gilbert and Giavarini, but the CMECS group only includes the parts related to the Tidal Lichen Zones."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Freshwater Submerged and Regularly Flooded Tidal Lichen Zone,552,Submerged or regularly flooded freshwater tidal areas dominated by lichens that can tolerate regular inundation. This zone includes the Submerged Zone described by Gilbert and Giavarini.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Freshwater Tidal Forest/Woodland,579,"Tidal riverine areas dominated by salt-intolerant tree species that are greater than 6 meters tall. The list of Biotic Communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Freshwater Tidal Lichens,430,Freshwater tidal areas dominated by salt-intolerant lichen species that form patches or visible patterns on the surface of the substrate. Freshwater lichen Biotic Groups are based on a modification of Gilbert and Giavarini (1997).
BC,Biotic Group,6,Freshwater Tidal Marsh,569,"Tidally influenced riverine marshes with salinity levels less than 0.5, which are dominated by salt-intolerant, herbaceous species (e.g., <i>Juncus</i> sp., <i>Eleocharis</i> sp., and <i>Zizania</i> sp.). Non-tidal, palustrine, freshwater marshes are beyond the scope of CMECS. The list of Biotic Communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Freshwater Tidal Moss,432,Freshwater tidal areas dominated by moss species.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Freshwater Tidal Scrub-Shrub,575,"Tidal areas dominated by shrub or immature tree species that are less than 6 meters tall and are salt intolerant. Salinity levels are less than 0.5. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Gastropod Reef,503,"Areas dominated by consolidated aggregations of living and dead gastropod mollusks, typically those of the Family Vermetidae or the Genus <i>Crepidula</i>. Shells in a ""reef"" must have consolidated or conglomerated into a reef structure with some relief and permanence; a reef is more that an accumulation of loose shells. Vermetids construct tubes that are cemented to hard substrates and to conspecifics, generally in intertidal habitats, e.g., <i>Serpulorbis</i>. <i>Crepidula</i> forms reefs through preferential settling of larvae on conspecifics (Zhao and Qian 2002) combined with very limited mobility, and sediment infilling. <i>Crepidula</i> reefs are generally flat features with little vertical relief."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Gelatinous Zooplankton,403,"Water parcels in which gelatinous zooplankton (generally transparent, often quite large organisms, in which water constitutes a very high percentage of the body mass) are the perceived dominant feature. Most gelatinous zooplankton are predators on other zooplankton."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Glass Sponge Reef,502,"Areas dominated by one or more of the three species of glass sponges that appear to be the primary contributors to the framework of extant glass sponge reefs: <i>Heterochone calyx, Aphrocallistes vastus</i>, and <i>Farrea occa</i>. See Figure 8.8 for an example of a Glass Sponge Reef."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Glass Sponge Reef Biota,422,"Areas dominated by live, deep-water, glass sponges (Order: Hexactinosida) present in densities that are judged sufficient to form substrate. These sponges construct a complex siliceous skeleton that provides structure and relief on the seafloor, creating habitat for many other organisms."
BC,Biotic Group,6,High Salt Marsh,570,"Salt marshes dominated by herbaceous, emergent vegetation and forb-like dwarf shrubs; areas are infrequently flooded by tides and characterized by distinctive patterns of halophytic vegetation (e.g., <i>Spartina patens</i>). Low shrubs may be present, but they are not dominant. Shrub-dominated portions of salt marshes are included in the Saltwater Tidal Scrub-Shrub Wetland Biotic Group. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Holothurian Bed,530,"Soft sediment assemblages dominated by holothurians or ""sea cucumbers"", which are common in both shallow and deep areas of the ocean. Holothurians common on sand or mud bottoms generally have features adapting them to life in soft sediment, and many species feed by ingesting sediment and associated organic matter as they burrow through the substrate. Tracks, trails, or feces left by these echinoderms may also be characteristic (see Fecal Mounds, also Tracks and Trails in the Inferred Fauna section below). The Holothurian Bed group is used only when the holothurians are present; use the Tracks and Trails or Fecal Mounds Biotic Groups when there is evidence of their presence, but living individuals are not seen."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Hydroid Bed,531,"Areas dominated by hydroid species that are not attached to a hard substrate. These animals may be resting on the sediment surface or may be partially embedded in the sediment. Hydroids are the benthic life stage of planktonic jellyfish medusae, and most are predators on small life forms. Hydroids are colonies of individual polyps usually arranged in a branching or bushy pattern. The polyps are specialized for various roles, and defensive/prey capture polyps are armed with nematocysts (stinging capsules in specialized cells). Hydroids may form large mounds or mats in some soft sediment areas."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Inferred Fauna,427,"Areas dominated by evidence (real or inferred) of faunal activity, but where the fauna themselves are not currently present or evident, given the sampling methodology."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Jellyfish Aggregation,450,"Water parcels in which jellyfish (free-swimming Medusozoan life-history stages) aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton. Most jellyfish are predators, and many have venomous nematocysts (stinging capsules in specialized cells)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Krill Aggregation,441,"Water parcels in which shrimp-like krill constitute the dominant form of zooplankton. Most krill species are filter feeders, with a preference for diatoms. Biomass per square meter can be very high in krill aggregations, and they are a critical food source for many large consumers."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Larger Deep-Burrowing Fauna,521,"Assemblages dominated by the presence—or evidence—of larger, deep-burrowing, soft-bodied, generally worm-like infauna. Characteristic taxa include larger (body width > 2 millimeters) annelids (segmented worms), enteropneusts (acorn worms), sipunculids (peanut worms), priapulids (phallus worms), nemerteans (ribbon worms), echiuroids (spoon worms), and/or other worm-like fauna, typically living > 5 centimeters below the sediment-water interface. Diverse mixes of fauna are common, and biotic communities may or may not be identifiable with an abundant or distinctive dominant taxon. Large fecal casts, mounds, burrows, feeding voids, etc., may be taken as evidence of deep-burrowing fauna. However, areas characterized by larger, tube-building worms (that construct a significant tube structure rising above the sediment-water interface, but may live with a body position below the sediment surface) are classified as Larger Tube-Building Fauna. Burrowing fauna with shells (e.g., clams and crustaceans) are covered below in other biotic groups."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Larger Tube-Building Fauna,538,"Soft sediment areas dominated by larger tube builders (tube width > 2 millimeters, or tube length > 30 millimeters), most commonly polychaetes, but including many other worm-like phyla (phoronids, sipunculids), crustaceans, and others. The tubes may be constructed in a variety of ways to produce calcareous, leathery, sandy, mucus-bound, chitinous, fibrous, papery, and other types of tubes. The animal itself may reside above or below the sediment surface, within the constructed tube. Some tube-building species (e.g., <i>Asabellides oculata</i>) may form extremely dense mounds of tubes that rise many centimeters above the seafloor. If colonization and growth of these fauna and their tubes results in the construction of substrate that is relatively stable, these faunal structures may be classified as Reef Biota."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Larval Worm Aggregation,460,"Water parcels in which larvae of various worm taxa aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton. Many worm larvae are difficult to identify. The initial larval stage of annelids (the rounded, ciliated trochophore stage) is very similar to the trochophore stage of larval mollusks. Annelid larvae will continue growth by adding segments, however, and become more worm-like."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Larval Worm Spawning Aggregation,459,"Water parcels in which gametes and larvae from various worm taxa are aggregated (often in very high abundance) after simultaneous spawning, and they are the dominant form of zooplankton. Epitokes may also be present. Epitokes are the detachable swimming gonad sections that form the posterior end of many species of polychaetes in their pre-breeding stage; these epitokes are released during spawning events, and appear as free-swimming worms."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Leathery/Leafy Algal Bed,562,"Areas dominated by leathery/leafy algae have a variety of specialized tissues (including thalli) that resemble stems and leaf-like blades. They generally maintain their shape when removed from water, and they often possess air bladders (pneumatocysts) and other flotation bodies."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Low and Intermediate Salt Marsh,571,"Salt marshes that are regularly flooded by tides so as to support characteristic halophytic vegetation (e.g., <i>Spartina alterniflora</i>). In locations with appropriate topography and tidal exchange, extensive meadows may form. Shrubs are less common in these areas. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Marine Intertidal Lichen Zone,554,Zones dominated by patches of lichens that are regularly submerged by marine tides. This zone corresponds to the Littoral Zone described by Fletcher.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Marine Lichens,431,Marine tidal areas dominated by lichen species that form patches or visible patterns on the surface of the substrate. Marine Lichen Biotic Groups are based on a modification of Fletcher (1973).
BC,Biotic Group,6,Marine Supratidal Lichen Zone,555,"Zones dominated by patches of lichens in association with the supratidal zone (splash zone). These areas are rarely submerged, but are regularly wetted by splash and sea spray. These lichen zones are most often associated with rocky shores with abundant sea spray. This zone corresponds to the Supralittoral Zone described by Fletcher."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Massive Coral Reef,496,"Reefs dominated by massive corals (also known as boulder or mound corals) that are characteristically ball- or boulder-shaped and relatively slow growing. This group includes reefs dominated by submassive corals, which are similar to massive corals, but have a lumpier structure. Brain corals are an example of massive coral.<br/><br/>Massive and submassive corals are resistant to strong water currents, and are therefore commonly found in shallow and mid-depth waters. These forms are common on back-reef slopes. See Figure 8.5 for an example of the massive coral growth form."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Mat/Film Forming Microbes,429,"Areas dominated by microbes that form soft structures, generally through accumulations of conspecifics and other microbes into a matrix that appears as strands, a thin film, or a thicker mat."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mesh/Bubble Algal Bed,563,"Areas dominated by mesh or bubble algae that form small, generally spherical masses attached to the benthos. They may develop lobes as they grow, but they do not further differentiate at the macro level. These masses may be hard or leathery, and they can sometimes be hollow. Bubble algae can be fast growing, quickly colonizing exposed reef surfaces, overtaking new coral growth, and deterring other animals from attaching there."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Microbial Aggregation,419,"Aggregations of microbes within the water column that have detectable, visible color. Microbial communities suspended in the water column can reach high concentrations and even be the dominant biota in an area, both numerically and in terms of biomass. Suspended free-floating microbes, as well as those adsorbed to suspended particulates are important in the marine food web. The concentration of bacterial communities has been linked to discoloration of the water column (Hansel and Francis 2006) via oxidation of molecular compounds in the water, such as manganese and iron."
BC,Biotic Class,4,Microbial Communities,392,"Areas dominated by colonies of microscopic or single-celled organisms that form a hard structure, visible film, layer, or mat on or near the surface of the substrate. Colonies may be composed of benthic microalgae (e.g., diatoms), photosynthetic bacteria (e.g., cyanobacteria), archaea, saprotrophic bacteria (e.g., decomposers or decay organisms), chemoautotrophic bacteria, or other microbial groups. These features may exist on or near the surface of the sediment either subtidally or subaerially (Figure 8.12), or they may exist as extensive areas of decay associated with dead organisms that have fallen to the seafloor (Figure 8.13).<br/><br/>Note: There may be high levels of biotic diversity within microbial mats. Microbial mats are often encountered in extreme environments where grazing pressure from multi-cellular organisms is reduced; for example, they can be observed in the high intertidal zone, in areas of low dissolved oxygen, and in deep-sea areas around thermal vents."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Microbial Foam,418,"Aggregations of microbes within the foam matrix that forms on the water's surface. Sea foam is the foam the lies on the sea surface, in the surf zone and at times on intertidal areas, created from dissolved organic compounds when air is forcefully injected into the water column (Harden and Williams 1989). Foam formation is aided by properties of lignans, proteins and carbohydrates that act as surfactants or foaming agents. The large area presented by the micro-bubbles composing seafoam is an ideal surface for concentration and adherence of microbial communities including bacteria, viruses and microscopic plankton. The characteristics of the air-water interface, and particularly of sea foam are unique compared to the bulk water column (Lion and Leckie 1981) and possess unique physical and chemical properties. The foams are well-oxygenated, sites of photolytic processes and tend to support high levels of aerobic metabolism with high organic processing rates. Surface foam is the site of intense trophic activity at the microbial level because of the concentration of microbial biomass, sugars, lipids and other growth compounds and thus represents an important part of the marine microbial food web. Concentration and transformation of trace metals, nutrient compounds, contaminants and pollutants also occurs in sea foam and can enter the food web via microbial pathways. The properties of the foam have also been identified as delivering growth-promoting nutrients and organic material to seagrass and kelp communities."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Microphytobenthos,548,"Areas dominated by a visible accumulation of benthic diatoms, cyanobacteria, unicellular algae, and other single-celled organisms. These may appear at the surface of the substrate in the form of either (a) a thin film or stain or (b) a thicker crust or ""felt."" These forms may occur on rock or unconsolidated substrates in subtidal, intertidal, or supratidal areas."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mineral Boring Fauna,1208,"Areas where specialized fauna have bored into hard mineral substrate (rock, shell, carbonate reef, peat, compacted stiff clay) and constitute the dominant biological feature by percent cover or biomass. Several taxa (including sponges, sipunculids, clams, mussels, gastropods, annelids and others) have developed mechanisms for boring into rock, shell and other mineral substrates."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mixed Crustacean Larvae,443,"Water parcels in which several forms of crustacean larvae are mixed, and together they constitute the dominant form of zooplankton. This biotic group is meant to be used for mixes where it is very difficult to identify a dominant Crustacean genus or species."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mixed Echinoderm Larval Aggregation,446,Water parcels in which these larval forms aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mixed Shallow/Mesophotic Coral Reef,500,Areas where multiple coral growth forms are present and none are clearly dominant.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Mixed Zooplankton,461,Water parcels in which complex mixes of zooplankton are the perceived dominant feature.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mixed Zooplankton Aggregation,462,"Water parcels in which several phyla exist, with no clear dominant taxon. Biotic Communities are described by listing abundant or potentially dominant taxa."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mobile Crustaceans on Hard or Mixed Substrates,1213,"Areas where the epifaunal community is dominated by slow-moving crustaceans on hard or mixed substrates, often living on, between, or under rocks. Many of these animals feed on organic detritus, debris, or small fauna. This group is limited to the epifaunal crustacean taxa that are relatively non-motile (e.g., hermit crabs, xanthid crabs, grapsid crabs, mysids, palaemonids and other small shrimps, amphipods, isopods) and cannot move outside the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. This group does not include the larger, more mobile, usually predatory crustacean forms (e.g., swimming crabs, <i>Cancer</i> crabs, large spider crabs, penaied shrimps), which should be recorded as Associated Taxa with another Biotic Group (see Section 10.3.1)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mobile Crustaceans on Soft Sediments,526,"Areas where the epifaunal or surface community is dominated by slow-moving crustaceans. This group is limited to the relatively non-motile, epifaunal, crustacean taxa (e.g., hermit crabs, mole crabs, amphipods, mysids, isopods) and does not include the more mobile arthropod forms (e.g., swimming crabs, horseshoe crabs, penaied shrimps) which can leave the classified area in less than one day and are defined as Associated Taxa. Larger mobile crustacean forms that construct a semi-permanent home (lobsters, burrowing shrimps, etc.) are classified as Tunneling Megafauna. Small burrowing crustaceans with a body measuring < 2 mm in the smallest dimension are classified as Small Surface-Burrowing Fauna."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mobile Mollusks on Hard or Mixed Substrates,1214,"Areas dominated by slow-moving mollusks, most commonly gastropods. In general, the forms that reach densities sufficient to be defined as a Biotic Group are detritivores or suspension feeders. Slow-moving predatory mollusks (e.g., whelks, drills, octopods) tend to be less abundant, and would more typically be classified in CMECS as Co-occurring Elements, together with another Biotic Group."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mobile Mollusks on Soft Sediments,1222,"Areas dominated by epifaunal, slow-moving, generally detritivorous, herbivorous, or omnivorous gastropods, scaphopods, or other mollusks foraging at the surface of unconsolidated sediments. These animals may be partly buried in the substrate. Predatory mobile mollusks such as moon snails, octopods, or whelks are generally preying on another Biotic Group (e.g., Clam Bed) which (as the forage base) would normally constitute the dominant percent cover. In those cases, Mobile Mollusks would be described as a Co-occurring Element, e.g., ""Biotic Group: <i>Spisula</i> Bed with Co-occurring Element: <i>Polinices</i> Bed""."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Molluscan Holoplankton,404,Water parcels in which mollusk holoplankton are the perceived dominant feature. Certain molluscan taxa with reduced shells exist entirely in the plankton.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Molluscan Meroplankton,405,Water parcels in which molluscan larvae are the perceived dominant feature.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Mollusk Reef Biota,423,"Areas dominated by consolidated aggregations of living and dead mollusks, usually bivalves (e.g., oysters or mussels or giant clams) or gastropods (e.g., vermetids) attached to their conspecifics and sufficiently abundant to create substrate."
BC,Biotic Class,4,Moss and Lichen Communities,393,"Tidal areas dominated by submerged or emergent mosses or lichens. Communities dominated by mosses are limited to freshwater situations. Although some mosses have been reported in tidal salt marshes, they have not been reported as dominant (Garbary et al. 2008). Lichens, on the other hand, occur in both freshwater and marine environments in relatively recognizable zones based on, among other factors, the extent to which they are submerged or flooded (Hawksworth 2000; Fletcher 1973; Gilbert and Giavarini 1997). Lichens are generally recognized as a symbiotic association with a fungus and an alga (or cyanobacterium) living together and forming patches or a visible pattern on the surface of the substrate."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mussel Bed,532,"Soft-sediment areas dominated by mussel species that are not attached to a hard substrate. These animals may be resting on the sediment surface, partially embedded in the sediment, or attached to conspecifics (by using their byssal threads), or to a piece of gravel in Slightly Gravelly Fine Sediments. Individuals in the Mussel Bed Group are not present in densities sufficient to construct substrate; in that case, they would be classified as Mussel Reef."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Mussel Reef,504,"Areas dominated by the ridge- or mound-like structures formed by the colonization and growth of mussels that are attached to a substrate of live and dead conspecifics. Mussels use byssal threads and a powerful glue to tether their shells to a substrate, and their reefs also provide valuable habitat and filtration."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Oligozoic Biota,543,"Zones that are devoid of macrofauna, larger fauna, and microbial mats, i.e., where no evidence of larger multicellular life can be detected when a sufficient area of the substrate is sampled to deliver sub-millimeter resolution, and where microbial communities are not visible to the naked eye. Interstitial meiofauna, however, may be present or inferred. It is inappropriate to identify this biotic group with sampling methods that are not capable of sub-millimeter resolution and cannot detect infauna that may reside below the surface in soft sediments. Sampling methods which can resolve this biotic group include retrieval of substrate followed by sieving with < 0.5 millimeter mesh size and stereoscopic examination, and sediment profile imaging with cameras that provide sub-millimeter resolution at the faceplate. This biotic group is found in areas of extremely high stress (e.g., anoxic zones, highly toxic areas, and high-energy pebble or cobble beaches) where conditions cannot support larger multicellular life. Oxic areas of subtidal mineral sands are generally sparsely colonized by multicellular organisms (e.g., haustoriid amphipods, syllids and other small polychaetes) and are not considered Oligozoic Biota."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Oyster Bed,534,"Soft-sediment areas dominated by oyster species that are not attached to a hard substrate and are not present in densities sufficient to construct substrate. These animals may be resting on the sediment surface, partially embedded in the sediment, or attached to conspecifics."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Oyster Reef,505,Areas dominated by the ridge- or mound-like structures formed by the colonization and growth of oysters that are attached (cemented) to a substrate of live and dead conspecifics. Oyster reefs provide excellent structural habitat as well as effective water filtration.
BC,Biotic Group,6,"Pelletized, Fluid Surface Layer",544,"Areas distinguished by a fluid, fecal-rich, pelletized surface layer, which is typically 5 - 15 millimeters thick (Rhoads and Young 1970). This layer is characteristic of deposit-feeding polychaetes, deposit-feeding clams, and/or other fauna. This layer is indicative of deposit feeders, but is not always present in deposit feeding communities, particularly when currents are sufficient to remove the layer."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Pennatulid Bed,537,"Subtidal soft-bottom habitats that are dominated by sea pens or sea pansies (Phylum Cnidaria, Order Pennatulacea). These are colonial octocorals with a central stem-like support attached to a root-like peduncle, adapted for life in soft sediments. An arrangement of suspension-feeding polyps in a single plane on two sides of the central stem (which is a specialized polyp) gives some sea pens the overall appearance of a feather or quill pen. The root-like peduncle is embedded in soft sediments, but the sea pen can move to a new area if conditions are unfavorable. Sea pansies are more compact and fleshier than sea pens. Pennatulids are often common in deeper waters."
BC,Biotic Class,4,Phytoplankton,387,"This class includes areas of floating or suspended microscopic algae that are capable of photosynthesis. Although some species are motile, they are generally passively transported by water movements. Under certain conditions, they can form aggregations, large blooms or colonies.<br/><br/>The spatial and temporal expressions of phytoplankton are described as three types in CMECS. (1) Aggregations are detectable concentrations of one or more species within a defined volume or area. Aggregations form when conditions are sufficient for growth of phytoplankton and are typically represented as mixed aggregations, but often with a single species or group predominating. (2) Blooms are defined as rapid growth and multiplication of single species to high density in an area of surface waters within a short period of time (days), often to the exclusion of other species. Blooms are often considered to be harmful to the ecology of the system and may represent an imbalance of conditions. (3) Phytoplankton maxima layers are expressed as defined layers of one or more species, often with one group predominating, that form at depth within the water column, whose thickness is small relative to its areal extent. Maxima layers generally occur in response to presence of optimal conditions, such as salinity and temperature or the supply of a limiting resource, such as nutrients, for growth along an interface."
BC,Biotic Setting,91,Planktonic Biota,384,"Planktonic Biota includes biota that drift, float, or remain suspended in the water column in aggregations that are big enough to be (a) detected by the human eye (or with mild magnification) or (b) sampled with a fine-plankton net. Planktonic biota are not regularly associated with the seafloor. Water parcels may be examined for plankton using a dipnet, a water sampler, a towed plankton net, imagery (including ""Plankton Cameras"" that are moved through the water), or other means. In all cases, plankton are assigned classifications based on perceived dominance by the observer (either based on mass or numbers, as specified by the user/observer). Because most plankton communities are mixes of many types of zooplankton and phytoplankton, practitioners should consider the widespread use of the Co-occurring Elements modifier (when non-dominant taxa are covered in other parts of the CMECS classification) or the Associated Taxa modifier (when non-dominant taxa do not constitute a CMECS classification unit)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Plate Coral Reef,497,"Reefs dominated by plate corals that grow in a flattened plate, saucer-like, or thin sheet fashion—often in a terraced pattern. Plate corals (also known as laminar, leaf, or sheet corals) usually have thin, disc-shaped colonies with corallites growing only on one side. See Figure 8.6 for an example of a plate coral growth form."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Polychaete Aggregation,458,"Water parcels in which holoplanktonic polychaetes (distinctively segmented worms, generally with parapodia and setae modified into swimming appendages) are the dominant form of zooplankton."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Protozoan Holoplankton,406,"Water parcels in which single-celled protozoans are the perceived dominant feature. CMECS considers only the larger, visible protozoans that form tests or shells."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Pteropod Aggregation,453,"Water parcels in which pteropod mollusks (characterized by a reduced shell and an expansive, wing-like foot) are the dominant form of zooplankton. They are sufficiently abundant in some areas of the ocean that their dead shells form ooze after sinking to the seafloor."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Radiolarian Aggregation,456,Water parcels in which radiolarians (amoeboid protists living in an intricate silica test) aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton. Radiolarians are particularly abundant in equatorial regions of the oceans.
BC,Biotic Class,4,Reef Biota,390,"Areas dominated by reef-building fauna, including living corals, mollusks, polychaetes or glass sponges.<br/><br/>In order to be classified as Reef Biota, colonizing organisms must be judged to be sufficiently abundant to construct identifiable biogenic substrates. When not present in densities sufficient to construct reef substrate, the biota is classified in the Aquatic Vegetation Bed or Faunal Bed classes.<br/><br/>The Reef Biota Class refers to only the living component of reef structures. If referring to the reef structure, users should use the reef units in the Geoform Component. If referring to the composition of the reef substrate independent of the living cover, users should employ the Coral Substrate, Shell Substrate, or Worm Substrate Classes in the Substrate Component (SC)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Sabellariid Reef,506,"Areas dominated by ridge- or mound-like features formed by the colonization and growth of living sabellariid worm species that have cemented sediment grains into complex structures. Certain types of sabellariid reefs most often occur parallel to an ocean shoreline in shallow water, but many are also found in deeper waters where current energy is high."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Salp Aggregation,451,"Water parcels in which salps (bag-like gelatinous filter-feeding tunicates) aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton. Many salps grow in a chain formation that can consist of 100 individuals or more, sometimes reaching 30 meters or greater in length, although much shorter chains are more common."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Saltwater Tidal Forest/Woodland,580,Tidal areas dominated by halophytic tree species that are greater than 6 meters tall.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Saltwater Tidal Scrub-Shrub,576,"Tidal areas dominated by halophytic shrubs or immature trees that are less than 6 meters tall. Vegetation is composed of halophytic species, chiefly shrubs and other herbaceous species. The vegetation is usually arranged in distinct zones of parallel patterns in response to gradients of tidal flooding frequency and duration, water chemistry, or other disturbances. The list of Biotic Communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Sand Dollar Bed,535,"Assemblages dominated by surface-dwelling, ""irregular"" echinoids of the Phylum Echinodermata and Order Clypeasteroida (e.g., sand dollars, sea biscuits). Sand dollars typically move on top of the sediment surface or burrow in the top few centimeters of sediment. Sand dollars are characterized by a flat body and short spines, to visually distinguish them from Burrowing Urchins and Soft Sediment Sea Urchins (see biotic groups below). Most sand dollars are deposit feeders; some are suspension feeders."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Scallop Bed,536,"Areas dominated by accumulations of scallops. Scallops have a series of small eyes and are mobile, clapping their shells together and pulsing through the water to escape predators such as starfish. Scallops may occur in high densities, but populations can be significantly affected by a number of factors, including larval recruitment, predation, and fishing pressure."
BC,Biotic Class,4,Scrub-Shrub Wetland,396,"Emergent wetland areas dominated by woody vegetation that is generally less than 6 meters tall. Characteristic species include true shrubs, young trees, and trees or shrubs that are small or stunted due to environmental conditions. Scrub-Shrub Wetland includes the shrub-dominated portions of high salt marshes—as well as stunted or low mangrove communities. This CMECS Class is equivalent to the Scrub-Shrub Wetland Class of FGDC-STD-004; however, the palustrine and non-tidal riverine portions of FGDC-STD-004 class are beyond the scope of CMECS."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Sea Urchin Bed,1225,"Sandy or muddy areas dominated by ""regular"" echinoids (e.g., sea urchins). These rounded urchins typically live on top of the sediment surface, and several species are well adapted to life on soft sediments, occurring in great numbers in certain locations."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Seagrass Bed,567,"Tidal aquatic vegetation beds dominated by any number of seagrass or eelgrass species, including <i>Cymocedea</i> sp., <i>Halodule</i> sp., <i>Thalassia</i> sp., <i>Halophilla</i> sp., <i>Vallisnera</i> sp., <i>Ruppia</i> sp., <i>Phyllospadix</i> sp., and <i>Zostera</i> sp. Seagrass beds (Figure 8.15) may occur in true marine salinities, and they may extend into the lower salinity zones of estuaries.<br/><br/>Seagrass beds are complex structural habitats that provide refuge and foraging opportunities for abundant and diverse faunal communities in shallow waters. Seagrass beds require a specific set of ecological conditions for success, and they are generally perceived as areas of high environmental quality.<br/><br/>The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Serpulid Reef,590,"Areas dominated by mound-like, bush-like, or patchy growths of living Serpulid worms that have secreted tubes of calcium carbonate to form complex aggregated structures. Serpulid worms can be distinguished from Sabellariid worms (see above) by the presence of a hard operculum that seals the hard, shell-like Serpulid tube. Living Serpulid reefs are extremely rare in U.S. coastal waters, but recently extinct Serpulid reef structures do occur, e.g., in certain Gulf of Mexico embayments. If no living Serpulid worms are present and the reef is extinct, it is classified in CMECS as Substrate (see Section 7.4.2). Living Serpulid reefs are, however, found in other parts of the world, and are considered valuable structure-forming habitat."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Sessile Gastropods,1215,"Hard substrate areas dominated by sessile (or mostly sessile) gastropods, often suspension feeders. Fauna in this biotic group may construct thick calcareous growths, but do not occur in abundance that is judged sufficient to construct a substrate; where these species are sufficiently abundant that they do construct substrate, they are classified in the Reef Class as Mollusk Reef (see above)."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Shallow/Mesophotic Coral Reef Biota,421,"Areas with ample light that are dominated by hermatypic (reef-building) hard corals or non-hermatypic reef colonizers.<br/><br/>The Shallow and Mesophotic Coral Reef Biota are largely based on the growth form of the dominant corals that (a) reflect differences in environmental conditions and (b) provide varied habitat circumstances (such as increased cover) for associated fish and invertebrate species. The same coral species can present different growth forms under different environmental circumstances. For example, <i>Acropora</i> sp. can have both branching and table growth forms, depending on the environment. To reflect the differences in the physical and biological environments, the same species may be used to define communities in more than one coral group."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Sheet Algal Bed,564,"Areas dominated by sheet (thallose) algae that form thin, undifferentiated, membranous sheets with no stipe or blades. Growth in these algae occurs in two directions. The sheets can be as thin as a single cell."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Siphonophore Aggregation,452,"Water parcels in which these jellyfish-like animals aggregate and are the dominant form of zooplankton. Siphonophores are colonies of many individual animals (polyps) that are each specialized for various roles (stinging tentacles, locomotion, and digestion) but appear and function as a single animal. Siphonophores are important predators on other zooplankton and small fishes. Most siphonophores are actively mobile, but the best-known siphonophore (the Portuguese man-of-war, <i>Physalia</i>) drifts with the wind using a gas-filled sac."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Small Surface-Burrowing Fauna,522,"Areas dominated by small, burrowing, often worm-like fauna with a body width usually < 2 millimeters; animals are typically found within 5 centimeters of the sediment-water interface. Common fauna include oligochetes, polychaetes, sipunculids, flatworms, nematodes, priapulids, small enteropneusts (acorn worms), and other phyla. Burrowing fauna other than worms may also be characteristic (e.g., small, surface-burrowing amphipods, mysids, copepods, or isopods). In many areas, surface fauna will be abundant, but individual animals generally associated with this group will be found living deeper than 5 centimeters; these areas are still classified as Small Surface-Burrowing Fauna."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Small Tube-Building Fauna,539,"Soft sediment areas dominated by tube-building annelids (e.g., spionids, sabellids), amphipods, small phoronids, or other small, surface-dwelling, tube-building fauna. These animals have a small tube width (< 2 millimeters), and the tubes often occur in dense mats. The animal itself may reside above or below the sediment surface within the constructed tube, which may be composed of a variety of materials (e.g., glued sediments, calcium carbonate, mucus, chitin, proteins)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Soft Sediment Basket Stars,1283,"Sandy or muddy areas characterized by brushy, many-armed echinoderms known as basket stars. Basket stars and the more common brittle stars are members of the class Ophiuroidea, but the arms of basket stars bifurcate many times to form a large complex that is reminiscent of a basket. Basket stars are usually larger than brittle stars, and maintain an upright form, generally clinging to solid objects, conspecifics, or other fauna using their bifurcated arms. In some soft sediment locations, basket stars form large entangled aggregations consisting of many individuals and covering large areas. Most basket stars are suspension feeders, but some species are more omnivorous or predaceous."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Soft Sediment Brittle Stars,1221,"Fine substrate assemblages dominated by crawling, burrowing or infaunal brittle stars, which are a relatively mobile class of echinoderms. Brittle stars may be either epifaunal or infaunal depending on the species and/or environmental conditions. In some situations, the central disc and several arms will be buried, but the remaining arm or arms will protrude typically ~ 1 centimeter to ~ 3 centimeters into the water column, where they may be mistaken for worms."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Soft Sediment Bryozoans,523,"Areas dominated by bryozoans (small colonial filter-feeding animals with a calcareous skeleton) that may grow in complex branched structures, bushy shapes, or other forms). Bryozoans may be either embedded in fine substrates or resting, unattached, on the sediment surface."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Soft Sediment Crinoids,525,"Areas dominated by crinoid species that are not attached to a hard substrate. Stalked crinoids or ""sea lilies"" may fix themselves to the soft seafloor or may move along the bottom. These animals and the motile (but often stationary, see Barnes 1980) comatulid ""feather stars"" are common in the deep sea and in other areas. They may be resting on the sediment surface, or they may be partially embedded in the sediment. Both groups of crinoids (sea lilies and feather stars) are suspension-feeding echinoderms with many branched arms."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Soft Sediment Fauna,426,"Areas that are characterized by fine unconsolidated substrates (sand, mud) and that are dominated in percent cover or in estimated biomass by infauna, sessile epifauna, mobile epifauna, mobile fauna that create semi-permanent burrows as homes, or by structures or evidence associated with these fauna (e.g., tilefish burrows, lobster burrows). These animals may tunnel freely within the sediment or embed themselves wholly or partially in the sediment. In many cases, they will regularly leave their burrows, and may move rapidly or swim actively after doing so, but any animal that creates a semi-permanent home in the sediment can be classified as Soft Sediment Fauna. These animals may also move slowly over the sediment surface, but are not capable of moving outside of the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. Most of these fauna possess specialized organs for burrowing, digging, embedding, tube-building, anchoring, or locomotory activities in soft substrates. Biotic communities in the Soft Sediment Fauna subclass are identified with the term ""Bed"", to distinguish them from Attached Fauna biotic communities (which do not include the term ""Bed"").<br/><br/>Within Soft Sediment Fauna, the Biotic Group is identified as the biota making up the greatest percent cover or the greatest estimated biomass within the classified area. Biota present at lesser percent cover or estimated biomass values within the classified area may be identified as Co-occurring Elements (See Section 10.6.2) or (if not a CMECS Biotic Group) as Associated Taxa (See Section 10.3.1). Associated Taxa include rapid epifaunal predators such as crustaceans, fishes, and other nekton that are capable of leaving the boundaries of the classification unit within one day. Associated Taxa may be capable of digging into the sediment surface to feed or hide (e.g., portunid crabs) but do not construct a semi-permanent burrow as would define Soft Sediment Fauna. For practitioners who wish to better characterize Soft Sediment Fauna, the Community Successional Stage Modifier (Section 10.3.2, including Figure 10.1 and Table 10.3) is a helpful addition to classifying soft sediment fauna, and can be applied to almost every soft-sediment area. This modifier provides ecological and functional information, and adds an element of assessment."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Sponge Bed,1223,"Sandy or muddy areas of the seafloor that are dominated by sponges and their associated communities, but do not create substrate such that they would be considered Reef Biota. Hexactinellid ""glass sponges"" that are capable of forming reefs may be classified as a Sponge Bed when occurring on sand or mud in densities not deemed adequate to compose a reef. Many sponge species have developed holdfast organs that adapt them to life in soft sediments, and can provide excellent structural habitat for other creatures, including the many commensal organisms that typically inhabit the tissues of living sponges."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Starfish Bed,1224,"Soft sediment areas in which starfish occur in large aggregations and clearly dominate the biota. Practitioners should note that, in most cases, starfish are predators on another Biotic Group (e.g., Clam Bed) which (as the forage base) would normally constitute the dominant percent cover or biomass. In those cases, Starfish would be described as a Co-occurring Element, e.g., ""Biotic Group: Clam Bed with Co-occurring Element: <i>Astropecten</i>""."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Stromatolites,547,"Areas dominated by large, mound-like formations built up in shallow marine areas by secretions of cyanobacteria, which further entrap minerals and sediment. They form Earth's oldest fossils and originated over 3 billion years ago."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Structure Forming Microbes,428,"Areas dominated by microbes that form a hard structure, generally through secretions and entrapment of minerals and sediments."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Submerged Freshwater Tidal Moss,556,Freshwater tidal areas dominated by submerged or regularly flooded moss species.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Table Coral Reef,498,"Reefs dominated by table corals that form platforms that are made up of small, tightly packed branches. Table corals are usually found in shallow waters. See Figure 8.7 for an example of the table coral growth form."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Tidal Forest/Woodland,438,Estuarine or tidal riverine areas with greater than 10% tree cover. This cutoff value is the standard employed by FGDC-STD-005-2008 for defining the Forest and Woodland Formation Class [FGDC 2008].
BC,Biotic Group,6,Tidal Mangrove Forest,581,"Tidally influenced, dense, tropical or subtropical forest with a shore zone dominated by true mangroves (and associates) that generally are 6 meters or taller (Figure 8.17). Dwarf shrub and short mangroves are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Shrubland Biotic Group.<br/><br/>Mangrove Forests (e.g., mangal or mangle) occur along the sheltered coasts of tropical latitudes of the Earth, and are commonly found on the intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries, usually in the region between the salt marshes and seagrass beds and may extend inland along river courses where tidal amplitude is high. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs.<br/><br/>The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Tidal Mangrove Shrubland,577,"Tidally influenced, dense, tropical or subtropical areas dominated by dwarf or short mangroves (and associates) that are generally less than 6 meters in height. Commonly found on intertidal mud flats along the shores of estuaries. Tidal mangrove shrublands may include immature stands or stunted mature trees that indicate a harsh growing environment. Areas characterized by tall mangroves (> 6 meters) are placed in the Tidal Mangrove Forest Biotic Group.<br/><br/>Where tidal amplitude is relatively low, the vegetation forms narrow bands along the coastal plains, and it rarely penetrates inland more than several kilometers along rivers. Where tidal amplitude is greater, mangroves extend further inland along river courses, forming extensive stands in the major river deltas. Also, mangrove cays may occur within the lagoon complex of barrier reefs.<br/><br/>The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Tidal Scrub-Shrub Wetland,437,Estuarine or tidal riverine areas dominated by shrub vegetation that has less than 10% tree cover. (The cutoff value is the standard employed by FGDC-STD-005-2008 for defining the Shrubland and Grassland Formation Class [FGDC 2008]).
BC,Biotic Group,6,Tracks and Trails,545,"Areas where sediment surface patterns are dominated by tracks and trails left by locomotion of mobile epifauna (e.g., snails, holothurians, crustaceans), and other fauna that are no longer present. These are common in deeper waters, and in other areas where sediments are less disturbed by physical energy. The appropriate invertebrate size modifier (e.g., Megafaunal, Macrofaunal) may be used to describe the sizes of the organisms suspected of leaving the marks being evaluated."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Tunicate Bed,540,"Sandy or muddy areas dominated by members of the subphylum Urochordata, including ascidians, sea squirts, and other tunicates. Tunicates are bag-like organisms that use incurrent and excurrent siphons for filter feeding and respiration. These animals may be resting on the sediment surface, partially embedded in the sediment, or attached to conspecifics. On both East and West coasts of the U.S., and in many other areas worldwide, colonies of the invasive sea squirt <i>Didemnum</i> are rapidly invading and smothering local biotopes."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Tunneling Megafauna,541,"Intertidal or Subtidal areas dominated by burrowing or construction activities of larger (megafaunal) organisms that create a water-filled tunnel with a diameter of > 1 centimeter. Tunneling activities are often attributable to crustaceans (generally decapods), but fishes (e.g., tilefish) and other taxa may also create large tunnel features. An associated mound of sediment may also be constructed. This biotic group is usually identified by the presence of tunnels or structures; the actual animal may be difficult to locate."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Turbinate Coral Reef,499,"Areas dominated by turbinate corals that are cone shaped. Turbinate corals are often found in calmer water at mid-depth levels, often on back reef-slopes."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Turf Algal Bed,565,"Areas dominated by turf algae that represent a multi-specific assemblage of diminutive, often filamentous, algae that attain a canopy height of only 1 - 10 millimeters (see Steneck 1988 for review). These microalgal species have a high diversity (more than 100 species in the western Atlantic), although only 30 - 50 species commonly occur at one time. There is a high turnover of individual turf algal species seasonally; only a few species are able to persist or remain abundant throughout the year. But turf algae—when observed as a functional group—remain relatively stable year round (Steneck and Dethier 1994), and they are often able to recover rapidly after being partially consumed by herbivores. Turfs are capable of trapping ambient sediment, and they kill corals by gradual encroachment."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Vegetated Freshwater Tidal Mudflat,572,"Tidal mudflats in freshwater riverine systems colonized by sparse, emergent, salt-intolerant vegetation."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Vegetated Salt Flat and Panne,573,"Tidal Salt Flats or Pannes (see GC for definition) colonized by sparse, emergent, halophytic, herbaceous or woody forb vegetation. The list of biotic communities for this group is long: a few examples are provided below, and the complete list is available in Appendix F."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Vegetated Tidal Flats,436,"Tidal Flats or Pannes (see GC for definition) colonized by herbaceous vegetation, usually with sparse cover. Cover is not sufficiently dense or raised to constitute a marsh."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Veliger Aggregation,454,Water parcels in which veligers or pedi-veligers (the distinctive larvae of many mollusks) are the dominant form of zooplankton. Veligers are characterized by ciliated lobes attached to a formative shell and body.
BC,Biotic Group,6,Vent Microbes,551,"Areas dominated by chemoautotrophic bacteria living on or near hydrothermal vents. These bacteria can use the chemicals present around the vent as an energy source. The bacteria are present in the water column and on substrate near vents as bacterial mats, films, and strands. They form the primary food source (as symbionts or as free-living bacterial clusters) for the gigantic and diverse fauna that inhabit Vent Communities. Vent Microbes colonize new vents, making the area hospitable to other fauna."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Vent/Seep Communities,519,"Areas near deep-sea vents and seeps, often dominated by very large fauna (e.g., bivalves, pogonophorans) which derive nutrition from chemoautotrophic bacteria that can utilize the chemicals present in the vent or seep as an energy source. Many Vent/Seep Communities are spectacular ecosystems with very high biomass and a diversity of unusual fauna. These areas are often characterized by hard substrates due to the active geologic processes that create vents and seeps."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Wood Boring Fauna,1209,"Anthropogenic or natural wood substrate areas characterized or dominated by specialized fauna that have bored into the wood. Several taxa, including teredos or shipworms (bivalves), gribbles (crustaceans), and others have developed the ability to bore into wood so as to obtain food, protection, or both. Once wood-boring fauna have begun to break the wood apart, other fauna will move in to occupy spaces within the wood, feeding on detritus, wood-borers, plankton, and other fauna."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Worm Holoplankton,407,Water parcels in which various holoplanktonic worm phyla are the perceived dominant feature.
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Worm Meroplankton,408,"Water parcels in which various meroplanktonic worm phyla are the perceived dominant feature. Many worm taxa spawn planktonic larvae, and identification can be difficult."
BC,Biotic Subclass,5,Worm Reef Biota,424,"Areas dominated by relatively stable, ridge- or mound-like aggregations of living and non-living material formed by the colonization and growth of worm species (e.g., sabellariids)."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Xenophyophores,546,"Areas (typically found in hadal zones and on the abyssal plains) dominated by tests of large, living, benthic foraminifera (""forams""), most of which are epifaunal, moving very slowly over the seabed. The tests of these single-celled organisms may be surprisingly large, several or many centimeters in size. The multi-nucleated single cell lives in the interlaced fine tubules that constitute the structure of the test. The tests are made of secretions, scavenged minerals, and small particles around the tubules, and may take many shapes—rounded, globular, densely branching, or stick-like (protruding vertically from the sediment, with a portion that is buried). Evidence suggests that Xenophyophores exist in high densities over large areas of the abyssal and hadal seafloor."
BC,Biotic Group,6,Zooplankton,385,"Water parcels or layers in which zooplankton are perceived to be the dominant feature. Zooplankton are heterotrophic biota of the water column; zooplankton drift with the currents, but may (or may not) be able to move through the water under their own power. Zooplankton may feed on phytoplankton, other zooplankton, or on detritus. CMECS classifies zooplankton that may range in size from gigantic salp chains (strings of gelatinous filter feeding tunicates that attain a length of 30 meters or more), to radiolarians (minute, shelled amoebas). CMECS was not designed to be used for the smallest planktonic forms (nanoplankton or picoplankton). CMECS Class Zooplankton includes both Holoplankton (that live out their entire life histories in the plankton) and Meroplankton (that are transient in the plankton). Meroplankton are typically larval stages that develop into nekton or benthos as they mature. Meroplankton in general are difficult to identify; specialized taxonomic knowledge and sets of regional keys are generally required. Both Holoplankton and Meroplankton are quite diverse and include members of most marine phyla.<br/><br/>Aggregations of specific types of zooplankton (or of mixed zooplankton/phytoplankton communities) may occur in many forms. In general, an ""Aggregation"" is a relatively dense and homogeneous group of plankton that may be produced by rapid reproduction in-place under favorable conditions (by phytoplankton and holoplankton), by hydrodynamic forcing, by a common mass origin, by plankton motility (e.g., diurnal vertical migrations), by barriers to movement (e.g., pycnoclines), or by other phenomena. A Spawning Aggregation forms after a mass spawning event when synchronous spawning by many individuals produces large pulses of gametes and larvae. Classification of a Spawning Aggregation requires some evidence of recent mass spawning. Aggregations of all types may occur as amorphously shaped packets of water, may occur in layers at various depths, and may occur as diurnal migrations, among other forms."
GC,Tectonic Setting,21,Abyssal Plain,30,"A flat region of the deep ocean floor (with a slope less than 1:1,000) that was formed by the deposition of pelagic and gravity-current sediments, which obscure the pre-existing topography. Vast areas of the ocean floor fall within this setting, which can be subdivided into smaller basins based on regional topography."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Abyssal/Submarine Fan,39,"A low, outspread, relatively flat-to-gently sloping mass of loose material—shaped like an open fan or a segment of a cone—deposited by a flow of water at the place where it issues from a narrower or steeper-gradient area into a broader area, valley, flat, or other feature. Abyssal fans form at the mouths of submarine canyons, and fans are also the result of turbidities (that is, gravity-driven, underwater avalanches)."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Aggregate Coral Reef,200,"Continuous, high-relief coral formation that occurs in various shapes and lacks sand channels. This type includes linear coral formations that are oriented parallel to the shelf edge (Zitello et al. 2009)."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Alluvial Fan,90,"A low, outspread, relatively flat (or gently sloping) mass of loose rock material, shaped like an open fan or a segment of a cone. The rock material was deposited by flowing water where it issues from a narrow valley or where the gradient abruptly changes. Alluvial fans are usually steeper than the surrounding surface."
GC,Geoform Origin,18,Anthropogenic,217,"In many coastal and deep oceans, artificial structures (such as piers, breakwaters, bulkheads, berms, drilling rigs, and artificial reefs) are a significant part of the environment. The continually (or intermittently) submerged portions of features attract vagile fauna and provide attachment surfaces for plants and sessile animals. These features can also provide shelter from predators and prevailing current, and they can support niche communities that increase overall biodiversity. However, these structures can also have negative effects (such as altering natural hydrodynamic patterns, interfering with animal movement, and increasing contaminant loading into nearshore areas), and thus are often of interest to resource managers.<br/><br/>The same relationship between Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms prevails in this origin type as in the geologic and biogenic categories; however, due to the complexity of some of the anthropogenic structures, many more Level 2 units may be present in a single Level 1 geoform. Besides physical structures, features that are the result of human activity (such as scars and trawl marks) are included among the anthropogenic geoforms."
GC,Geoform,19,Apron,12,"An extensive, subaqueous, blanket-like deposit of alluvial, unconsolidated material that is derived from an identifiable source and deposited at the base of a mountain or seamount."
GC,Geoform,19,Aquaculture Structure,218,"These structures can take many forms: lines suspended over the sediment, floating wooden frameworks sub-tidal structures attached to the benthos such as wooden piers and platforms, and pens and enclosures (both at the surface and submerged). These structures are associated with the cultivation of fish, crustaceans, and shellfish for human use or consumption. They may be integrated into shallow water bays and ponds, or they may be deployed in deeper water. Due to their structural aspects, they can be attractive to fish and other animals. They are often sources of nutrients and, thus, have impacts on the surrounding ecology."
GC,Geoform,19,Artificial Bar,219,Shoal or bar constructed by human activity to influence the movement of water and tides—or reduce surface wave activity within an area.
GC,Geoform,19,Artificial Dike,221,"A raised, linear barrier intended to contain or hold back water in order to prevent flooding of adjacent land. These may be concrete or fill structures."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Artificial Levee,222,"(a) A dike along the side of a river channel erected to prevent overflow during floods, usually running along the channel direction and near the natural levee crests of streams. (b) An artificial embankment constructed along the bank of a watercourse or an arm of the sea to protect land from inundation (or to confine stream flow to its channel)."
GC,Geoform,19,Artificial Reef,223,"An artificial structure placed on the ocean floor to provide a hard substrate for sea life to colonize. Artificial reefs are constructed by sinking dense materials (such as old ships and barges, concrete-ballasted tire units, concrete and steel demolition debris, and dredge rock) on the seafloor within designated reef sites."
GC,Geoform,19,Artificial Scar,224,"A gouge or deformation of the bottom, or an area where the surface of the substrate, vegetation, or other colonizing organisms have been removed by abrasion or impact. These may be temporary or permanent features."
GC,Geoform,19,Atoll,185,"A ring-like coral reef that nearly (or entirely) encloses a reef lagoon. The volcanic island normally associated with an atoll may or may not be present. Atolls appear in plain view as a roughly circular reef that is surmounted by a chain of closely spaced, low, coral islets that encircle (or nearly encircle) a shallow lagoon in which there is no land or islands of non-coral origin; the reef is surrounded by open sea."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Authigenic Carbonate Outcrop,147,"These outcrops result from the slow seepage of fluid containing dissolved carbon. They form pavements, chimneys, and rings, donuts, or slabs (Stakes et al. 1999)."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Back Barrier Flat,95,"A subaerial, gently sloping landform on the lagoon side of the barrier beach ridge. These flats are composed predominantly of sand washed over (or through) the beach ridge during tidal surges (modified from Jackson 1997)."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Backshore,169,"The upper or inner zone of the shore or beach that is above the high-water line of mean spring tides and below the upper limit of shore-zone processes. The backshore is usually dry or moistened by spray, and is acted upon by waves (or covered by water) only during exceptionally severe storms or unusually high tides. It is essentially horizontal or slopes gently landward, and it is divided from the foreshore by the crest of the most seaward berm."
GC,Geoform,19,Bank,13,"An elevated area above the surrounding seafloor that rises near the surface. Banks generally are low-relief features, of modest-to-substantial extent, that normally remain submerged. They may have a variety of shapes and may show signs of erosion resulting from exposure during periods of lower sea level. Banks tend to occur on the continental shelf. Banks differ from shoals in having greater size and temporal persistence. The Geoform Bank differs from the Coral Reef Zone modifier Bank based on its geologic origin."
GC,Geoform,19,Bar,14,"A relatively shallow place (in a stream, lake, sea, or other body of water) that is typically a submerged ridge, or bank consisting of (or covered) by sand or other unconsolidated material—but may also be composed of rock or other material (modified from Jackson 1997)."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Barrier Beach,59,"A narrow, elongate, coarse-textured, intertidal, sloping landform that is generally parallel with the beach ridge component of the barrier island (or a spit), and which is adjacent to the ocean (Jackson 1997; Peterson 1981)."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Barrier Cove,72,A subaqueous area adjacent to a barrier island (or submerged barrier beach) that forms a minor embayment or cove within the larger basin.
GC,Geoform Type,20,Barrier Flat,96,"A relatively flat, low-lying area that is separating the exposed (or seaward) edge of a barrier beach or barrier island from the lagoon behind it. Barrier flats commonly include pools of water, and may be barren or vegetated. These flats are an assemblage of both deflation flats left behind migrating dunes and/or storm washover sediments."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Barrier Island,113,"A long, narrow, sandy island that is above high tide and parallel to the shore. Barrier islands commonly have dunes, vegetated zones, and swampy or marshy terrains extending lagoon-ward from the beach."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Barrier Reef,40,"A long, narrow coral reef, roughly parallel to the shore and separated from it by a lagoon of considerable depth and width. This reef may enclose a volcanic island (either wholly or in part), or it may lie a great distance from a continental coast (such as the Great Barrier Reef). Generally, barrier reefs follow the coasts for long distances—often with short interruptions that are called passes or channels. Three principle examples of this type of feature are Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the New Caledonia Barrier Reef, and the Meso-American Barrier Reef system—although similar features exist elsewhere."
GC,Geoform,19,Basin,15,General term for an area of the seafloor or land surface that lies below the surrounding bottom or terrain elevation. They are normally areas of low relief.
GC,Geoform Type,20,Basin Floor Fan,91,Deposition of submarine fans on the lower slope or basin floor; fan formation is associated with the erosion of canyons into the slope and the incision of fluvial valleys into the shelf. Siliciclastic sediment bypasses the shelf and slope through the valleys and canyons to feed the basin floor fan; sediment may be deposited at the mouth of a canyon or in an area widely separated from the canyon mouth—or a canyon may not be evident.
GC,Geoform Type,20,Bay Mouth Bar,21,"A bar of sand or gravel extending partially or entirely across the mouth of a bay. It usually connects two headlands, thus straightening the coast."
GC,Geoform,19,Beach,16,"A gently sloping zone formed by unconsolidated material at the shoreline, typically with a concave profile. This zone extends landward from the low-water line to either (a) the place where there is a definite change in material or physiographic form (such as a cliff) or (b) the line of permanent vegetation. Only those portions of the beach within the splash zone would be within the CMECS system; areas of the beach further inland are terrestrial systems."
GC,Geoform,19,Beach Berm,17,The natural bench or platform lying below the main beach slope and above the foreshore.
GC,Geoform Type,20,Beach Ridge,143,"A low, essentially continuous mound of beach (or beach-and-dune material) heaped up by the action of waves and currents on the backshore of a beach, beyond the present limit of storm waves or the reach of ordinary tides. The ridge can occur singly or as one of a series of approximately parallel deposits. The ridges are roughly parallel to the shoreline and represent successive positions of an advancing shoreline."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Beach Scarp,154,"An almost vertical slope (caused by wave erosion) that fronts a berm on a beach. Scarps may range in height from several centimeters to a few meters, depending on the character of the wave action and the nature and composition of the beach."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Bight,41,"A broad bend or curve in a generally open coast. Examples include the South Atlantic Bight and the Southern California Bight. These are distinguished from Embayment/Bays by the shallower angle between the apex of the bight and the adjacent coasts, although the term <i>Bay</i> has been used to name these features (e.g., Bay of Campeche)."
GC,Geoform Origin,18,Biogenic,184,"Biogenic geoforms are physical features and landforms that were created by the action of living organisms (bioherms). These primarily consist of the different types of reefs. Examples of these generally hard, fixed structures include the incorporation of dissolved calcium carbonate into reef structure by corals, aggregations of mollusk shells into a fixed cohesive substrate, or the cementation of existing sediments into an aggregation of worm tubes. As with all geoforms the characteristic of concern in this component is the physical shape of these reef features, not the living biology that may have participated in their genesis. Any of the reef geoforms may or may not have living coral or other life present."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Biogenic Deep Coral Reef,197,"Persistent structures, formed by deepwater corals, whose growth exceeds (bio) erosion. These reefs result in local topographic highs that alter hydrodynamic and sedimentary regimes. The actual reef structure remains, often with the growing reefs on their crest or side. The coral thickets and skeletal remains trap sediments, contributing to the accretion of the reef (Roberts et al. 2009)."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Borderland,42,"An area of the continental margin (between the shoreline and the continental slope) that is topographically more complex than the continental shelf. This feature is characterized by ridges and basins, some of which are below the depth of the continental shelf."
GC,Geoform,19,Boulder Field,18,"An area dominated by large, boulder-sized (256 millimeters - 4,096 millimeters) stones or pieces of rock. These can occur below cliffs or at the foot of steep slopes or canyons, where they are the result of depositional processes. These fields can also occur as the result of currents that have removed the finer sediments."
GC,Geoform,19,Breachway,230,The shoreline that is created along the channel formed by jetties.
GC,Geoform,19,Breakwater/Jetty,228,"Structures extending more or less perpendicularly from the shore into a body of water, which are designed to direct and confine the current or tide, to protect a harbor, or to prevent shoaling of a navigable inlet by littoral materials."
GC,Geoform,19,Bulkhead,231,"An artificially reinforced section of the shoreline (or the structure itself). These can be composed of piles of natural material (such as rip-rap), or they may resemble walls of timbers or other substance. They may have many purposes but generally are not intended to prevent flooding of lower areas."
GC,Geoform,19,Buoy,227,"Anchored objects that float in a relatively fixed position at the water surface. Most buoys are used as navigational aids and markers for channels, but many buoys also contain scientific or other observational instruments."
GC,Geoform,19,Burrows/Bioturbation,186,"Tubes, holes, furrows, and small mounds formed by the digging, feeding, and movement of benthic fauna. These can bring nutrients and other compounds to the surface—as well as destabilize the substrate."
GC,Geoform,19,Cable,233,Structures that serve as linear conduits for electricity or as supporting lines for other in-water or above-water infrastructure.
GC,Geoform,19,Cable Area,232,"An area through which one or more cables have been placed in (or on) the substrate. These areas can be navigation hazards, so they are commonly noted on nautical charts. Scarring, debris, and other features associated with cable installation or maintenance may be present."
GC,Geoform,19,Canal,234,"(a) Man-made channels produced to facilitate navigation between water bodies. (b) Generally linear, dredged, closed-ended ditches that have been dug between housing units along the coast."
GC,Geoform,19,Cave,19,A natural passage extending beneath the earth's surface.
GC,Geoform,19,Channel,65,"A general term for a linear or sinuous depression on an otherwise more flat area (for example, a valley- or groove-like feature through which water flows). This is a very broad term that is often used in connection with other terms to provide more meaning."
GC,Geoform,19,Cone,70,"(a) A type of submarine, fan-shaped deposit—especially a deep-sea fan associated with a major active delta (such as deltas of the Mississippi, Nile, and Ganges Rivers). (b) A formation resulting from the extrusion of material onto the surrounding seabed (e.g., a volcanic cone)."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Continental/Island Rise,43,An area that lies at the deepest part of a continental or island margin between the continental slope and the abyssal plain. The rise is a gentle incline (with slopes of 0.5° to 1°) and it has generally smooth topography—although it may bear submarine canyons.
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Continental/Island Shelf,44,"That part of the continental margin that is between the shoreline and the continental slope (or a depth or 200 meters when there is no noticeable continental slope); it is characterized by its very gentle slope of 0.1°. Island shelves are analogous to the continental shelves, but surround islands."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Continental/Island Shore Complex,45,"This feature includes the land-water interface zone and contains geoforms across a diversity of scales. For CMECS, the supratidal zone forms the landward limit of geoforms found within the shore complex setting. This setting does not include the land-water interface along tidal rivers that may extend a considerable distance inland."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Continental/Island Slope,46,"That part of the continental margin that is between the continental shelf and the continental rise (if there is one); it is characterized by its relatively steep slope of 1.5 - 6°. Island slopes are analogous to the continental slopes, but occur around islands."
GC,Tectonic Setting,21,Convergent Active Continental Margin,31,"Intense areas of active magmatism, where the oceanic lithosphere is subducted beneath the continental lithosphere. This results in chains of volcanoes near the continental margin; the leading edge of the continental plate is usually studded with steep mountain ranges."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Coral Head/Bomme,202,"Individual, massive coral colonies—usually with a boulder or mound-like shape."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Coral Pinnacle,203,"A hard, columnar structure formed primarily by the growth of hard corals and other encrusting organisms. These can occur as isolated vertical structures or in association with other pinnacles."
GC,Geoform,19,Coral Reef Island,190,A tropical island built of organic material derived from the skeletons of corals and other reef associates. Coral islands are usually low and may be several kilometers in size. Typically their structure is integrally part of a living or relatively recent coral reef.
GC,Geoform,19,Cove,71,"A small, narrow, sheltered bay or recess in an estuary; often found inside a larger embayment (modified from Jackson 1997)."
GC,Geoform,19,Dam,235,"An obstruction across a flow that produces a lake, pond, or other widening."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Deep Coral Carbonate Mound,198,"Topographic seafloor structures that are the result of previous periods of coral growth, often with successive periods of reef development, sedimentation, and erosion. These are elevated structures, composed of coral fossils and accumulated interstitial sediments. This type includes structures variously referred to as carbonate knolls, coral banks, bio-buildups, and lithoherms. Coral carbonate mounds can take on various shapes and sizes, reaching tens of meters in height and tens of kilometers in size. They may or may not currently include biogenic reefs (Roberts et al. 2009)."
GC,Geoform,19,Deep/Cold-Water Coral Reef,196,"Reefs formed by deepwater azooxanthellate (i.e., lacking symbiotic algae), stony corals (Order Scleractinia). Aggregations of these colonial corals can form structures that range from small patch reefs that are several meters across, to large reefs and giant carbonate mounds up to 300 meters high and several kilometers in diameter; these reefs form over many thousands to millions of years (Roberts, Wheeler, and Freiwald 2006)."
GC,Geoform,19,Delta,74,"The low, nearly flat, alluvial tract of land at (or near) the mouth of a river. Deltas commonly form a triangular or fan-shaped plain of considerable area, which is crossed by many distributaries of the main river; deltas may extend beyond the general trend of the coast, and occur as a result of the accumulation of river sediment supplied in such quantities that it is not removed by tides, waves, and currents."
GC,Geoform,19,Delta Plain,80,"The level (or nearly level) surface that makes up the landward part of a large delta; strictly, a flood plain characterized by repeated channel bifurcation and divergence, multiple distributary channels, and interdistributary flood basins."
GC,Geoform,19,Depression,81,General term for any relatively sunken part of the earth's surface—especially a low-lying area surrounded by higher ground. Depressions often have no natural outlet for surface drainage (such as an interior basin or a karstic sinkhole) (Jackson 1997).
GC,Geoform,19,Diapir,83,A dome or anticlinal fold in which the overlying rocks or sediments have been ruptured when the plastic core material was squeezed out. Diapirs in sedimentary strata usually contain cores of salt or shale; igneous intrusions may also show diapiric structure.
GC,Geoform,19,Dike,85,"A tabular, igneous intrusion that cuts across the bedding or foliation of the country rock. Dikes are often more resistant to erosion than the surrounding country rock, and dikes can form long ridges."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Disintegration Moraine,123,"A drift topography characterized by chaotic mounds and pits (generally randomly oriented) developed in supraglacial drift by collapse and flow as the underlying stagnant ice melted. Slopes may be steep and unstable, and there will be used and unused stream courses and lake depressions interspersed with the morainic ridges. Characteristically, there are numerous abrupt changes (lateral and vertical) between unconsolidated materials of differing lithology."
GC,Tectonic Setting,21,Divergent Active Continental Margin,32,Areas where tensional tectonic forces result in the crustal rocks being stretched and—ultimately—split apart or rifted. These areas are marked by subsidence and a continental rise.
GC,Geoform,19,Dock/Pier,236,"A landing place for vessels normally oriented perpendicular to the shore with a flat surface for off-loading materials. Docks may be fixed in position through anchors or piles, or be supported by pilings or other structures."

GC,Geoform,19,Dredge Disturbance,240,"An area of the seafloor impacted by dredging activities. In this instance, the term is meant to apply to secondary scarring, smothering, or destruction of epibenthic and near-surface infaunal communities by dredging activity (rather than the direct removal of material by dredging which would be characterized under the Dredged Channel or other geoforms)."
GC,Geoform,19,Dredged/Excavated Channel,237,"A roughly linear, deep area within an existing water body formed by a dredging operation for navigation purposes (after Wells et al. 1994)."
GC,Geoform,19,Drilling (Oil and Gas) Rig,241,"Large structures built to house workers and machinery needed to drill wells in the ocean bed in order to extract oil or other natural resources. They may be attached to the ocean floor, consist of an artificial island, or be floating; rigs often provide important structure and attachment points for marine animals."
GC,Geoform,19,Drumlin,583,"Drumlins are products of the streamline (laminar) flow of glaciers, which molded the subglacial floor through a combination of erosion and deposition. A drumlin is a low, smooth, elongated-oval hill, mound, or ridge of compact till, which has a core of bedrock or drift. A drumlin usually has a blunt nose facing the direction from which the ice approached, and a gentler slope tapering in the other direction. The longest axis is parallel to the general direction of glacier flow."
GC,Geoform,19,Drumlin Field,86,"Groups or clusters of closely spaced drumlins or drumlinoid ridges, distributed more or less en echelon, and commonly separated by small, marshy tracts or depressions (interdrumlins)."
GC,Geoform,19,Dune,88,An active accumulation of sand (formed by wind action) with some elevation; dunes occur on a beach or further inland.
GC,Geoform,19,Dune Field,87,"An assemblage of moving and/or stabilized dunes; sand plains; interdune areas; and the ponds, lakes, or swamps produced by the blocking of waterways by migrating dunes (U.S. Department of Agriculture 2008)."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Ebb Tidal Delta,76,"A largely subaqueous (although sometimes intertidal), crudely fan-shaped delta with sand-sized sediment, which has been formed on the seaward side of a tidal inlet (modified from Boothroyd et al. 1985; Davis 1994; Ritter, Kochel, and Miller 1995)."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Ebb Tidal Delta Flat,97,"The relatively flat, dominant component of the ebb tidal delta. At extreme low tide, this landform may be exposed for a relatively short period (U.S. Department of Agriculture 2008)."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Embayment/Bay,47,"A water body with some level of enclosure by land at different spatial scales. These can be wide, curving indentations in the coast, arms of the sea, or bodies of water almost surrounded by land. These features can be small—with considerable freshwater and terrestrial influence—or large and generally oceanic in character."
GC,Geoform Type,20,End Moraine,124,A ridge-like accumulation that is being (or was) produced at the outer margin of an actively flowing glacier at any given time; a moraine that has been deposited at the outer or lower end of a valley glacier.
GC,Geoform Type,20,Erosion Scarp,153,"A long, steep slope or line of cliffs at the edge of a plateau or ridge formed by erosion."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Esker,144,"A long, narrow, sinuous, steep-sided ridge composed of irregularly stratified sand and gravel that was deposited as the bed of a stream flowing in a subglacial ice tunnel (within or below the ice) or between ice walls on top of the ice of a wasting glacier. Eskers remain behind as high ground when the glacier melts. Eskers range in length from less than a kilometer to more than 160 kilometers, and the height range is 3 - 30 meters."
GC,Geoform,19,Fan,89,"A low, outspread gently to steeply sloping mass of loose material, which is shaped like an open fan or a segment of a cone. Fans are made of material deposited by a flow of water at the place where it issues from a narrower or steeper gradient area into a broader area, valley, flat, or other feature."
GC,Geoform Type,20,Fault Scarp,152,"A feature caused by the rapid erosion of soft rock on the side of a fault (as compared to that of more resistant rock on the other side), for example, the east face of the Sierra Nevada in California."
GC,Geoform,19,Fill Area,242,A topographically low area into which unconsolidated material has been placed in order to raise the ground level as part of development or expansion of coastal infrastructure.
GC,Geoform,19,Fish Pond,244,"These are mostly enclosed basins, usually along the shore used to trap fish. During high tide they are open to the sea but as the tide recedes they become cut off to allow capture of the trapped fish. These features may be very old and have strong cultural and archaeological significance."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Fjord,48,"A long, narrow, glacially eroded inlet or arm of the sea. They are often U-shaped, steep-walled, and deep. Because of their depth, they tend to have low surface-area-to-volume ratios. They have moderate watershed-to-water-area ratios and low-to-moderate riverine inputs. Fjords often have a geologic sill formation at the seaward end caused by glacial action. This morphology—combined with a low exchange of bottom waters with the ocean—can result in formation of hypoxic bottom waters."
GC,Geoform,19,Flat,94,A general term for a level (or nearly level) surface or area of land marked by little or no relief; flats are often composed of unconsolidated sediments (such as mud or sand).

This size determination may be an areal extent or a linear distance. Larger geoforms (Level 1) are generally larger than one square kilometer, and correspond to Megahabitats in the Greene et al. classification system (2007). These features can be defined using geologic or geomorphic maps and bathymetric images of the seafloor at map scales of 1:250,000 or less. Smaller geoforms (Level 2) are generally less than one square kilometer in size (or less than 1 kilometer in distance); and correspond to Meso-and Macro-habitats in the Greene et al. system. Level 2 geoforms (such as individual coral reefs, tide pools, and sand wave fields) can be identified through in-situ observational methods (such as underwater videography) or through low-altitude, high-resolution optical or acoustic remote sensing."
GC,Geoform Type,,Geoform Type,,"Geoform types are varieties of geoforms that provide further information on morphology and physical processes underway at any individual geoform. Users are encouraged to apply the Type designations where applicable—but they are not required to use it if their data do not support this level of detail. Users are also encouraged to provide the full nesting (recording of upper-level attributes) for any geoforms they identify, although there will be many instances where this is not practical."
GC,Geoform Origin,18,Geologic,11,"Geologic geoforms are formed by the abiotic processes of uplift, erosion, volcanism, deposition, fluid seepage, and material movement.

They tend to have a very high surface to volume ratio, low to moderate watershed to water area ratio and can have a high wetland to water ratio. The flushing times tend to be long relative to riverine estuaries and even embayments, as the restricted exchange with the marine end member and reduced river input lengthen residence times."
GC,Physiographic Setting,17,Lagoonal Estuary,50,"This class of estuary tends to be shallow, highly enclosed, and have reduced exchange with the ocean. They often experience high evaporation, and they tend to be quiescent in terms of wind, current, and wave energy. Lagoonal estuaries usually have a very high surface-to-volume ratio, a low-to-moderate watershed-to-water-area ratio, and can have a high wetland-to-water ratio. The flushing times tend to be long relative to riverine estuaries and embayments because the restricted exchange with the marine-end member and the reduced river input lengthen residence times. As such, there tends to be more benthic-pelagic interaction, enhanced by generally shallow bathymetry. Additionally, exchange with surrounding landscapes (often riparian wetland and palustrine systems) tends to be enhanced and more highly coupled than in other types of estuaries.<br/><br/>Occasionally, a lagoon may be produced by the temporary sealing of a river estuary by a barrier. Such lagoons are usually seasonal and exist until the river breaches the barrier; these lagoons occur in regions of low or sporadic rainfall."

These estuaries are often characterized by a V-shaped channel configuration and a salt wedge.<br/><br/>High inputs of land drainage can promote increased primary productivity, which may be confined to the water column in the upper reach, due to low transparency in the water column. Surrounding wetlands may be extensive and healthy, given the sediment supply and nutrient input. This marsh perimeter may be important in taking up the excess nutrients that are introduced to the system.

A directional, coherently flowing water mass. Currents operate on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales from huge ocean gyres and major surface and deepwater currents of the ocean operating on annual timescales to tidal currents that operate on sub daily timescales. However, all currents have features in common: the advective movement and transport of water, constituents (such as particulates and dissolved compounds), qualities (such as temperature and salinity) and biota (such as plankton, nekton, and megafauna). Currents are driven by gravity flow, geostrophic flow, density differences, hydraulic differential or energy input. They may be isolated from land and freely flowing in the water column as is the Gulf Stream, or they may be in channelized flow or long-shore flow.

WC,Hydroform Type,92,Ekman Downwelling,654,"Downwardly-directed current, resulting from either the convergence of water masses or from the convergence of a water mass with a coastline. At this convergence, gravity will force water into a downwelling, which will carry surface water to greater depths. In the nearshore, the circulation will take the water to the shallow bottom and then move seaward. In deeper waters, the downwelling will carry water to a depth determined by energy dissipation and relative density considerations; the maximum downwelling depth can be into the abyssalpelagic zone."
WC,Hydroform,10,Ekman Flow,635,"The flow of water at 90˚ to the direction of the wind, at steady state, due to Earth's rotational effect."
WC,Hydroform Type,92,Ekman Upwelling,653,"Upwardly-directed current resulting from either the divergence of water masses or from movement of surface water away from the coast. At the divergence of two water masses (or the wind-driven movement of water away from a coastline), continuity of mass flow will move water from depth to the surface as replacement. In the nearshore, the circulation will bring the water from the shallow bottom. In deeper waters, the upwelling will carry water from a variety of depths—from near the surface to depths to as great as 500 meters (below the pycnocline). Because the upwelled water is working against gravity, its maximum influence is not as great as downwelled water (which is aided by gravity); however, the upwelling can reach into the mesopelagic zone."

WC,Hydroform,10,Hydrothermal Plume,677,"A discharge of hot fluids from sea-bottom vents associated with volcanic or tectonic activity.

WC,Hydroform,10,Ice,678,"Frozen form of water, which is less dense than liquid water; ice floats on the surface of liquid water, sometimes extending into deep water zones. This property drives a number of important biological and physical processes in the ocean, including preventing freezing of the ocean to the bottom. Ice either floats on—or forms a solid cover on—the underlying water, which isolates atmospheric input for the duration of cover. Nonetheless, strong circulation and water motion occurs in the aquatic system under the ice (driven by advection of adjacent water masses or thermal convection). Because freshwater freezes at a higher temperature than salt water, surface freezing of the ocean concentrates salt brine in the liquid water below the ice. Ice formation and ice cover maintenance is relatively stable in both spatial and temporal terms, determined by relative air and water temperatures, velocity of water movements, and geomorphology of the setting."

WC,Hydroform,10,Langmuir Circulation,637,"Rotational oscillatory motion of surface waters induced by wind and Coriolis deflection. This circulation is caused by the transport of a parcel of water obliquely to the direction of wind transport due to the apparent Coriolis force imparted by the rotation of the earth. In the Northern Hemisphere this vector is to the right of the wind direction, in the Southern Hemisphere, it is to the left. This causes a piling of water in cells lateral to the direction of travel. The piled water sinks to balance forces, and it also circulates to create elongated tubular circulations of water at the surface. Langmuir cells are important to productivity by circulating water through the water column, and form fronts at the junction of two Langmuir cells that are important points of aggregation and feeding of plankton and higher trophic levels (Wetzel 2001)."

This layer is aphotic; it receives biogenic, detrital and mineral material descending from above and this layer acts as an accumulation zone. Oozes from tests of planktonic organisms form on the seafloor and fans of sedimentary material accumulate here. There are diverse and specialized faunal communities at these depths.

Organisms at these depths are subjected to immense pressure; food webs depend on organic detritus rather than active photosynthetic production. Waters in this layer generally are composed of cold, bottom currents (from sinking water masses descending from polar latitudes)."
WC,Water Column Layer,8,Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Lower Layer,622,"Within the Epipelagic Layer, the region below the Epipelagic pycnocline if present (or below mid-depth [100 meters]). Photosynthesis can generally occur through this layer although diminishing with depth to the critical depth for phytoplankton, which represents the point where production and respiration are in balance and no net productivity occurs. The lower bound of the Epipelagic Lower Layer is the bottom of the Epipelagic Layer at 200 meters."
WC,Water Column Layer,8,Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Pycnocline,621,"Within the Epipelagic Layer, the Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Pycnocline is the zone of maximum vertical change in density of the water normally due to a salinity or temperature gradient, which segregates the water column into two distinct layers that are of relatively homogeneous density. The presence of a pycnocline provides a barrier to mixing between the upper and lower water columns, and this layer enhances the stability of the water column preventing mixing to the bottom."
WC,Water Column Layer,8,Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Upper Layer,620,"The Epipelagic Layer is the upper 200 meters of the oceanic water column. Within the Epipelagic, the Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Upper Layer is the region between the sea surface and the Epipelagic Pycnocline, if present, or mid-depth in the Epipelagic zone at 100 meters. This layer is generally well-mixed, well-lighted, and highly oxygenated, and supports photosynthesis largely throughout, although weakly in the lower depths.

Waters in this layer have unique characteristics of immense pressure, strong currents, accumulation of sediments and organic material; macrofauna that occur at these extreme depths have special feeding strategies and adaptations to intense pressure and total darkness."
WC,Water Column Layer,8,Marine Oceanic Mesopelagic Layer,623,"The region where light is vertically attenuated to below the level required for photosynthesis, generally between 200 meters and 1,000 meters in depth. Oxygen declines rapidly to a minimum, corresponding with the lower limit of the Mesopelagic Zone—due to high bacterial respiration from settling organic material."

These eddies play an important role in ocean mixing—and in sheltering and acting as nursery waters for biota. The most energetic eddies are at the smaller end of the spatial scale. The larger eddies (called mesoscale eddies) are slower moving, but they persist for many months and are ubiquitous in the global oceans. Mesoscale Eddies are most prevalent in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, but they can occur in all oceans."

WC,Biogeochemical Feature,12,Nutricline,1345,"The zone of rapid nutrient change with depth in the water column, often as a result of entrainment of water from a lower depth that is higher in concentration of a particular nutrient. The nutricline can be a rich source of a limiting nutrient and hence, the site of intense microbial or photosynthetic activity."

WC,Hydroform Type,92,Reverse Estuarine Flow,661,"An estuarine circulation where evaporation greatly exceeds freshwater input, as in hot dry climes, salinity is concentrated within the estuarine basin. This results in a salinity maximum in the estuary that can far exceed seawater salinity."
WC,Hydroform Type,92,Rip Current,668,A formation of water flow in a seaward direction generated by wave action and local topography nearshore. Shallow depressions in the sea floor or breaks in a bar will channel receding water at high velocity away from shore and through the surf zone after onshore wave action.
WC,Hydroform Type,92,River/Estuary Plume,695,"Formation of water resulting from the discharge of low-salinity water into marine waters of the ocean, forming a distinct layer of water on top of the seawater due to its lower density. The plume can extend for many kilometers and persist for months after the freshwater flow has stopped before being entrained into the seawater. These plumes are typically higher in nutrients, turbidity and productivity than the surrounding seawater and can gradually deliver those water quality characteristics to the adjacent ocean water."
WC,Hydroform Type,92,Salt Wedge Domain,662,"Portions of estuaries that have an unimpeded connection of bottom waters to the sea develop a wedge-shaped formation of high-salinity water in the bottom, with lower salinity water from upstream freshwater loading in the upper water column. The wedge form is developed as hydrostatic pressure of river water pushes against the incoming seawater and, being less dense, rides over it. The difference in salinity and density is important in estuarine chemistry and biology as the density barrier between upper and lower water columns restrains mixing and transport across the transitional gradient, called the pycnocline. This leads to an upper, autotrophic and lower, generally heterotrophic portion of the water column."

WC,Biogeochemical Feature,12,Seep,1350,"Area on the ocean bottom where fluid slowly emerges. Cold seeps are usually at the continental margins; waters in these seeps are often highly concentrated in minerals and dissolved gases, such as hydrogen sulfide, methane, and hydrogen. Cold-fluid seeps and oil seeps are sources of energy for chemoautotrophic communities of bacteria and archaea, which in turn support communities of clams, mussels and vestimentiferan tubeworms."
WC,Hydroform,10,Seiche,706,"A long-period, standing wave that creates an oscillatory sloshing of water within an enclosed water body. This is due to wind or pressure effects that cause water motions that resonate with the length scale of the water body."

WC,Hydroform,10,Storm Surge,707,"A propagation of water associated with intense meteorological and wind activity such as a tropical storm. The surge of water from deep into shallow waters and onto land is caused by wind forcing in the forward, shoreward direction and by pressure differential within a cyclonic storm that positions extreme low pressure over a section of ocean, permitting tides to rise above normal range."
WC,Hydroform,10,Sub-mesoscale Eddy,641,A reverse current with rotational movement created when fluid flows past an obstacle. Sub-mesoscale eddies are of size scale smaller than 20 kilometers.
WC,Hydroform,10,Surf Zone,708,"Zone with incipient wave breaks, which are the result of an increase in the steepness of the wave as the water depth decreases. The surf zone is the region extending from the seaward boundary of wave breaking to the limit of wave uprush. The surf zone is the specific subset of the wave hydroform where waves are breaking against a shoreline. This relatively narrow area occurs when waves encounter bottom friction and break, forming a region of high turbulence, mixing, and intense energy. This occurrence affects biota in the water column, as well as bottom and shore substrates and biota. The surf zone is highly variable temporally and spatially in extent, energy characteristics, and physicochemical properties; this variability is due to the tight coupling between the water column and the substrate it impacts. In areas of soft sediments, high turbidity can result. Benthic biota (such as diatom mats) can be mixed into the water column, imparting its photosynthetic parameters to the water column and elevating water-column productivity. Nutrients can also be mixed from disturbed sediments into the water column, elevating concentrations there."
WC,Biogeochemical Feature,12,Surface Film,1351,"Thin layer of materials and biota that exist on the surface of the water, often only a few microns thick. The surface film can contain a rich microbial community that consumes the material that concentrated in the film. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) is concentrated up to five times in the surface microlayer. These films are often aggregated and concentrated at frontal convergences of two water masses and can lead to formation of a rich community that feeds on the material."
WC,Biogeochemical Feature,12,Surface Mixed Layer,1352,The layer of water at the ocean surface that is mixed by wind. Water of homogeneous density is easily mixed to a depth determined by the intensity of wind shear and density of the water. Often wind mixing of the surface occurs to the pycnocline depth where density increases rapidly. The mixed layer depth is an important determinant of the extent and intensity of photosynthetic production as plankton cells are mixed through the vertical light gradient.

WC,Hydroform,10,Surface Wind Wave,710,"A surface wave generated by direct wind action on the water's surface producing shear, piling up water in the direction of the wind and generating a wave."
WC,Biogeochemical Feature,12,Thermocline,1353,"The zone of rapid temperature change with depth in the water column, often separating two layers of different, homogeneous temperature. As the density of water changes with temperature, the thermocline presents a barrier to vertical circulation and enhances water column stability."
WC,Hydroform,10,Thermohaline Eddy,642,Eddy formation due to the interaction of temperature and salinity differences between two water masses initiating convective flow.
WC,Hydroform,10,Tidal Flow,643,"Advective flow resulting from of tidal movement, often amplified in velocity when moving through an inlet, pass or channel. Tides are important in mixing the water column and transporting water, salt, nutrients and biota, particularly weak-swimming larval or non-motile planktonic forms. The life cycles of many organisms depend on tidal transport for survival."
WC,Hydroform,10,Tidal Front,673,"A front created by the linear convergence of two water masses brought into juxtaposition by tidal action. Generally the two masses will have differential characteristics such as temperature, density, and often of color and productivity. Fronts can be maintained as distinct due to these differences, which inhibit mixing across a density barrier. There is often strong vertical mixing on either side of the front, producing upwelling and aggregations of biota feeding on the material grown in situ or accumulated at the front."
WC,Hydroform Type,92,Topographic Wave,701,"A sub-basin scale wave that is driven by wind-stress from the passage of cyclones across or along the shelf, with long period (~ 5 days) and to which a vorticity is imparted by the apparent Coriolis effect."
WC,Hydroform,10,Tsunami,712,"A large long-wavelength (tens or hundreds of kilometers) ocean wave that is generated by a powerful undersea disturbance such as a landslide, earthquake, or volcano. The wave is nearly imperceptible in the open ocean but as it approaches land, it can reach heights of many tens of meters. They can have enormous destructive impact on the coast (and inland), as well as the biology of the nearshore zone."
WC,Hydroform,10,Turbidity Flow,644,A flow of water down slope carrying a dense suspension of fluid mud or unconsolidated material.
WC,Biogeochemical Feature,12,Turbidity Maximum,1354,"Region in an estuary where turbidity is high, due to concentration of particulates in the water column. This occurs as a result of the increasing ionic strength of the water from the introduction of salt in the downstream direction (generally at around areas with a salinity of 5), which causes particle aggregation. This process is enhanced by the mixing regime particular to this upper estuary region, in which countercurrent flows from the salt wedge are entrained into the seaward-flowing, upper-water layer. As particles settle out of the upper layer, they are carried upstream in the lower layer and so circulate within a zone of maximum turbidity."

WC,Temperature,22,Warm Water,724,20°C to < 25°C
WC,Hydroform Class,9,Water Mass,674,"The Water Mass Hydroform Class refers to a parcel of water with homogeneous properties (e.g., chemical, physical). If no other hydroform applies (or sufficient information is not available to classify the hydroform), the default would be a water mass that describes the general properties of the parcel. Any physicochemical property (or properties) can define a water mass. Common water mass types are those of homogeneous salinity, temperature or density—or a combination of those properties. The properties of a water mass generally change relatively slowly, because the factors that created and constrain the homogeneity tend to be buffered by the inertial properties of water itself. Thermal mass of water, for example, means that the water temperature will change much more slowly than air temperature. Non-conservative properties (such as nutrient concentration or pH) can change much more quickly, because biological processes can alter them."
WC,Hydroform Class,9,Wave,683,"The Wave Hydroform Class is a propagation of energy that moves through the water, causing a vertical, oscillatory motion with characteristic wavelength, amplitude, and celerity. Waves are of several types: internal, standing, and surface. Each type of wave propagates energy and impacts the waters, substrate, and biota that it contacts. Waves are initiated by an energy source (such as wind, landslides, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions), and they can occur at any depth in the water column. Wave energy varies depending on type and intensity of energy input; the wave regime can change on hourly timescales."

WC,Hydroform Type,92,Western Boundary Current,648,"The western portion of the great ocean gyre circulation, which moves along the eastern coasts of the continents. These currents are deeper (up to 1,000 meters) and faster moving than eastern counterparts. The western intensification, due to Coriolis forces being stronger in the latitudes of the Westerlies that steer Western boundary currents, is responsible for the great speed and intensity of these currents. WBCs transport warmer tropical waters into the cold higher latitudes and have a great effect on both oceanic and terrestrial climate, water temperatures and distribution of biota."
WC,Hydroform,10,Wind-driven Current,646,"Current caused by wind shear as distinguished by those caused by density differences, which result in thermohaline circulation. Though only a portion of the oceans are exposed to wind energy, winds are responsible for the great ocean gyres, dominant features of ocean circulation."
WC,Hydroform,10,Winter Water Mass,682,"The mass of water produced—and introduced to oceans—as a result of melting winter ice formations. These water masses tend to be fresher than surrounding waters, and they often flow over the denser salt water."
