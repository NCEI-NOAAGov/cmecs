W,l20,Marine Nearshore Lower Water Column,,,,,,,,,,,"Marine waters below the pycnocline (or mid-depth), from the land-water interface up to the 30 meter depth contour."
W,l21,Marine Oceanic Surface Layer,,,,,,,,,,,"The interface between the atmosphere and the water column, extending to a depth of several centimeters. Surface films, floating vegetation, and aggregations of materials or biota accumulate at the surface, which also represents the surface of maximum exchange of atmospheric gases, heat, and light."
W,l22,Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Upper Layer,,,,,,,,,,,"The Epipelagic Layer is the upper 200 meters of the oceanic water column. Within the Epipelagic, the Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Upper Layer is the region between the sea surface and the Epipelagic Pycnocline, if present, or mid-depth in the Epipelagic zone at 100 meters. This layer is generally well-mixed, well-lighted, and highly oxygenated, and supports photosynthesis largely throughout, although weakly in the lower depths. It has no contact with, and very minimal influence from land, and is very clear compared to coastal water masses. It is the zone of maximal productivity in the Oceanic Subsystem."
W,l23,Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Pycnocline,,,,,,,,,,,"Within the Epipelagic Layer, the Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Pycnocline is the zone of maximum vertical change in density of the water normally due to a salinity or temperature gradient, which segregates the water column into two distinct layers that are of relatively homogeneous density. The presence of a pycnocline provides a barrier to mixing between the upper and lower water columns, and this layer enhances the stability of the water column preventing mixing to the bottom."
W,l24,Marine Oceanic Epipelagic Lower Layer,,,,,,,,,,,"Within the Epipelagic Layer, the region below the Epipelagic pycnocline if present (or below mid-depth [100 meters]). Photosynthesis can generally occur through this layer although diminishing with depth to the critical depth for phytoplankton, which represents the point where production and respiration are in balance and no net productivity occurs. The lower bound of the Epipelagic Lower Layer is the bottom of the Epipelagic Layer at 200 meters."
W,l25,Marine Oceanic Mesopelagic Layer,,,,,,,,,,,"The region where light is vertically attenuated to below the level required for photosynthesis, generally between 200 meters and 1,000 meters in depth. Oxygen declines rapidly to a minimum, corresponding with the lower limit of the Mesopelagic Zone—due to high bacterial respiration from settling organic material."
W,l26,Marine Oceanic Bathypelagic Layer,,,,,,,,,,,"The region where light does not penetrate, rendering the water column totally dark except for bioluminescence, generally from 1,000 meters to 4,000 meters depth. Organisms at these depths are subjected to immense pressure; food webs depend on organic detritus rather than active photosynthetic production. Waters in this layer generally are composed of cold, bottom currents (from sinking water masses descending from polar latitudes)."
W,l27,Marine Oceanic Abyssopelagic Layer,,,,,,,,,,,"The region of the water column that is generally in contact with the abyssal seafloor, except in deep basins and trenches and represents the bottom layer of the ocean, generally from 4,000 meters to 6,000 meters depth. This layer is aphotic; it receives biogenic, detrital and mineral material descending from above and this layer acts as an accumulation zone. Oozes from tests of planktonic organisms form on the seafloor and fans of sedimentary material accumulate here. There are diverse and specialized faunal communities at these depths. Trophic webs are based on chemoautotrophic processes, hydrothermal vents, decomposition of organic matter and bacterial production."
W,l28,Marine Oceanic Hadalpelagic Layer,,,,,,,,,,,"The deepest waters of the globe occur in trenches and deep basins generally at depths greater than 6,000 meters. There is a high degree of tectonic and thermal activity in these areas. Waters in this layer have unique characteristics of immense pressure, strong currents, accumulation of sediments and organic material; macrofauna that occur at these extreme depths have special feeding strategies and adaptations to intense pressure and total darkness."

W,,,,,,,h1,Current,,,,,"Water that is undergoing coherent mass movement, either as laminar or turbulent flow, relative to surrounding waters and fixed structural, landform or geologic features. A directional, coherently flowing water mass. Currents operate on a wide range of temporal and spatial scales from huge ocean gyres and major surface and deepwater currents of the ocean operating on annual timescales to tidal currents that operate on sub daily timescales. However, all currents have features in common: the advective movement and transport of water, constituents (such as particulates and dissolved compounds), qualities (such as temperature and salinity) and biota (such as plankton, nekton, and megafauna). Currents are driven by gravity flow, geostrophic flow, density differences, hydraulic differential or energy input. They may be isolated from land and freely flowing in the water column as is the Gulf Stream, or they may be in channelized flow or long-shore flow. Currents that impact land also shape the littoral zone or sea bottom by winnowing sediments, physically mixing or shearing substrates and biota and creating geoforms such as sand ripples and bars."
W,,,,,,,h1.1,Current,Boundary Current,,,,The portion of an ocean gyre that moves along the continental boundary.
W,,,,,,,h1.1.1,Current,Boundary Current,Eastern Boundary Current,,,"The eastern portion of the great ocean gyres circulating in the ocean basins against west continental coasts. They may be broad or narrow and meandering; they transport colder water into the tropics. EBCs are typically shallow and slow-flowing compared to the Western boundary currents. EBCs may be associated with upwellings and nutrient rich seas that can support very productive fisheries, such as in the Peruvian Upwelling."
W,,,,,,,h1.1.2,Current,Boundary Current,Western Boundary Current,,,"The western portion of the great ocean gyre circulation, which moves along the eastern coasts of the continents. These currents are deeper (up to 1,000 meters) and faster moving than eastern counterparts. The western intensification, due to Coriolis forces being stronger in the latitudes of the Westerlies that steer Western boundary currents, is responsible for the great speed and intensity of these currents. WBCs transport warmer tropical waters into the cold higher latitudes and have a great effect on both oceanic and terrestrial climate, water temperatures and distribution of biota."
W,,,,,,,h1.2,Current,Buoyancy Flow,,,,"Current flow created by discontinuity in buoyancy of two juxtaposed water masses of different density, causing one to flow relative to the other toward buoyancy equilibrium."
W,,,,,,,h1.2.1,Current,Buoyancy Flow,Downwelling,,,Downwardly-directed current caused by convergence of water masses.
W,,,,,,,h1.2.2,Current,Buoyancy Flow,Upwelling,,,Upwardly-directed current caused by divergence of water masses
W,,,,,,,h1.3,Current,Current Meander,,,,"A current that deviates from a straight line flow, which is often the result of incursion by lateral currents or the presence of a physical or density barrier. Meanders can pinch off from the main current flow and form rings."
W,,,,,,,h1.4,Current,Deep Boundary Current,,,,"A current that connects high-latitude ocean waters (where deep water is formed) with upwelling regions. The core depths of these currents are between 1,500 meters and 4,000 meters. Western-located Deep Boundary Currents lie adjacent to continental slopes in all ocean basins."
W,,,,,,,h1.5,Current,Deep Circulation,,,,"The mass circulation of the oceans that carries cold polar surface water to depth, sinking due to higher density and wind forcing. The mass transport also carries salt, oxygen, and other properties. Deep circulation is wind driven, with a tidal mixing component. It cools the surface and evaporates water, which determines where deep convection occurs. Wind-driven turbulence in the deep ocean mixes cold water upward at lower latitudes. Deep circulation has relative slow current movements but transport of water is comparable to surface transport and is responsible for closing the Earth's heat budget and determining climate."
W,,,,,,,h1.5.1,Current,Deep Circulation,Abyssal Deep Circulation,,,"Deep, slow circulation in the abyssal zone driven by horizontal differences in density of water masses. The vast majority of ocean circulation is of this type, initiating by the sinking of cold water in the high latitudes to the ocean bottom, and spreading throughout the abyssal plains of the ocean basins."
W,,,,,,,h1.5.3,Current,Deep Circulation,Bathyl Deep Circulation,,,"Deep, slow circulation in the bathyl zone driven by horizontal differences in density of water masses. Water sinks down the continental slope and through the bathyl zone as part of thermohaline ocean circulation."
W,,,,,,,h1.6,Current,Deep Convection,,,,Large mass flows of water in the deep ocean that form critical parts (and return paths) of the great ocean circulation.
W,,,,,,,h1.7,Current,Density Flow,,,,Flow caused by differential density between two convergent water masses—or by a parcel of denser water flowing along a sloping bottom under a column of less-dense water.
W,,,,,,,h1.8,Current,Ekman Flow,,,,"The flow of water at 90˚ to the direction of the wind, at steady state, due to Earth's rotational effect."
W,,,,,,,h1.8.1,Current,Ekman Flow,Ekman Upwelling,,,"Upwardly-directed current resulting from either the divergence of water masses or from movement of surface water away from the coast. At the divergence of two water masses (or the wind-driven movement of water away from a coastline), continuity of mass flow will move water from depth to the surface as replacement. In the nearshore, the circulation will bring the water from the shallow bottom. In deeper waters, the upwelling will carry water from a variety of depths—from near the surface to depths to as great as 500 meters (below the pycnocline). Because the upwelled water is working against gravity, its maximum influence is not as great as downwelled water (which is aided by gravity); however, the upwelling can reach into the mesopelagic zone."
W,,,,,,,h1.8.2,Current,Ekman Flow,Ekman Downwelling,,,"Downwardly-directed current, resulting from either the convergence of water masses or from the convergence of a water mass with a coastline. At this convergence, gravity will force water into a downwelling, which will carry surface water to greater depths. In the nearshore, the circulation will take the water to the shallow bottom and then move seaward. In deeper waters, the downwelling will carry water to a depth determined by energy dissipation and relative density considerations; the maximum downwelling depth can be into the abyssalpelagic zone."
W,,,,,,,h1.9,Current,Inertial Current,,,,"Currents that continue motion through inertia. Due to the rotation of the Earth, inertial currents tend to form circular gyres."
W,,,,,,,h1.10,Current,Langmuir Circulation,,,,"Rotational oscillatory motion of surface waters induced by wind and Coriolis deflection. This circulation is caused by the transport of a parcel of water obliquely to the direction of wind transport due to the apparent Coriolis force imparted by the rotation of the earth. In the Northern Hemisphere this vector is to the right of the wind direction, in the Southern Hemisphere, it is to the left. This causes a piling of water in cells lateral to the direction of travel. The piled water sinks to balance forces, and it also circulates to create elongated tubular circulations of water at the surface. Langmuir cells are important to productivity by circulating water through the water column, and form fronts at the junction of two Langmuir cells that are important points of aggregation and feeding of plankton and higher trophic levels (Wetzel 2001)."
W,,,,,,,h1.11,Current,Mean Surface Current,,,,The time-averaged steady state ocean surface current pattern responsible for mean oceanic water motions.
W,,,,,,,h1.11.1,Current,Mean Surface Current,North Equatorial Surface Current,,,"The southern portion of the northern ocean gyres. This current flows westward, is maintained by the trade winds, and entrains some water from southern oceans into the northern oceans. It is accompanied by a weaker easterly-flowing counter current."
W,,,,,,,h1.11.2,Current,Mean Surface Current,South Equatorial Surface Current,,,"The counterpart to the North Equatorial current, also flows east to west, forming the northern limb of the southern ocean gyres."
W,,,,,,,h1.12,Current,Mesoscale Eddy,,,,"A rotational feature that (a) breaks off of an ocean gyre or large current (such as the Gulf Stream) and (b) persist autonomously for some period (from days to months) at sizes of 20 kilometers to 500 kilometers. These eddies play an important role in ocean mixing—and in sheltering and acting as nursery waters for biota. The most energetic eddies are at the smaller end of the spatial scale. The larger eddies (called mesoscale eddies) are slower moving, but they persist for many months and are ubiquitous in the global oceans. Mesoscale Eddies are most prevalent in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, but they can occur in all oceans."
W,,,,,,,h1.12.1,Current,Mesoscale Eddy,Cold Core Ring,,,"An eddy that forms when a boundary current meander pinches off and closes, trapping a parcel of colder water in a surrounding ring of warmer water. The ring measures up to 300 kilometers and extends to 4,000 meters depth or the ocean bottom. The colder water in the core tends to be higher in nutrients and more productive than that in the surrounding ring, so they become islands of biological activity as they move through the ocean. Rings form in all oceans and can persist for months to years."
W,,,,,,,h1.12.2,Current,Mesoscale Eddy,Warm Core Ring,,,"An eddy that form when a boundary current pinches off a parcel of warmer water. The ring measures 100-200 kilometers and extends to 1,500 meters depth. The warm water in the core tends to be less productive than the colder, nutrient rich waters in the ring."
W,,,,,,,h1.13,Current,Residual Current,,,,Current movement resulting from asymmetry in tidal flow—notably within a partially enclosed estuary or embayment—that results in characteristic estuarine circulation patterns.
W,,,,,,,h1.13.1,Current,Residual Current,Fjord Circulation,,,"Circulation in estuaries that possess a sill at the seaward end, inhibiting inflow of seawater into the bottom waters. Seawater flows over the sill mixing into the intermediate water of the estuary, and sinking to the bottom. The estuary receives freshwater input in excess of evaporation and the resulting brackish mixture is exported across the sill into the ocean end-member. The limited exchange of bottom waters can promote hypoxic conditions in some fjord estuaries."
W,,,,,,,h1.13.2,Current,Residual Current,Partially Mixed Domain,,,"An estuarine circulation with an intermediate level of advective and tidal energy, that can disrupt the density barrier between the fresher upper and salty lower water column of an estuary, entraining water in both directions. This results in a gradient of increasing salinity from top to bottom, with no barrier to mixing."
W,,,,,,,h1.13.3,Current,Residual Current,Reverse Estuarine Flow,,,"An estuarine circulation where evaporation greatly exceeds freshwater input, as in hot dry climes, salinity is concentrated within the estuarine basin. This results in a salinity maximum in the estuary that can far exceed seawater salinity."
W,,,,,,,h1.13.4,Current,Residual Current,Salt Wedge Domain,,,"Portions of estuaries that have an unimpeded connection of bottom waters to the sea develop a wedge-shaped formation of high-salinity water in the bottom, with lower salinity water from upstream freshwater loading in the upper water column. The wedge form is developed as hydrostatic pressure of river water pushes against the incoming seawater and, being less dense, rides over it. The difference in salinity and density is important in estuarine chemistry and biology as the density barrier between upper and lower water columns restrains mixing and transport across the transitional gradient, called the pycnocline. This leads to an upper, autotrophic and lower, generally heterotrophic portion of the water column."
W,,,,,,,h1.13.5,Current,Residual Current,Well-mixed Domain,,,"Reaches of estuaries where the tidal flux and/or the river discharge is sufficient to overcome the salt-wedge structure, the water column becomes well-mixed and vertical homogeneous."
W,,,,,,,h1.14,Current,Sub-mesoscale Eddy,,,,A reverse current with rotational movement created when fluid flows past an obstacle. Sub-mesoscale eddies are of size scale smaller than 20 kilometers.
W,,,,,,,h1.15,Current,Thermohaline Eddy,,,,Eddy formation due to the interaction of temperature and salinity differences between two water masses initiating convective flow.
W,,,,,,,h1.16,Current,Tidal Flow,,,,"Advective flow resulting from of tidal movement, often amplified in velocity when moving through an inlet, pass or channel. Tides are important in mixing the water column and transporting water, salt, nutrients and biota, particularly weak-swimming larval or non-motile planktonic forms. The life cycles of many organisms depend on tidal transport for survival."
W,,,,,,,h1.16.1,Current,Tidal Flow,Diurnal Tidal Flow,,,"Tidal ocean waters where, due to the geometry of the ocean basin and obstructions presented by land, a second daily tide is suppressed, resulting in a single or diurnal tide regime with one high and one low tide per day, as in the Gulf of Mexico."
W,,,,,,,h1.16.2,Current,Tidal Flow,Mixed Semi-diurnal Tidal Flow,,,"Tidal ocean waters where the amplitudes of two semi-diurnal tides are unequal, resulting in a stronger and a weaker high and low tide each day."
W,,,,,,,h1.16.3,Current,Tidal Flow,Semi-diurnal Tidal Flow,,,Tidal ocean waters where the gravitational action of the sun and moon on Earth's oceans create two high and two low tides per day of relatively equal amplitude.
W,,,,,,,h1.17,Current,Turbidity Flow,,,,A flow of water down slope carrying a dense suspension of fluid mud or unconsolidated material.
W,,,,,,,h1.18,Current,Wave-driven Current,,,,Residual current caused by asymmetrical force created by wave motion.
W,,,,,,,h1.18.1,Current,Wave-driven Current,Longshore Current,,,"A current that moves parallel to or at an oblique angle to the shoreline, carrying water and often transporting soft sediments downstream. Prevailing wind and wave directions can persist in a longshore direction for long periods, and are commonly responsible for the formation of spits, bars and many barrier islands."
W,,,,,,,h1.18.2,Current,Wave-driven Current,Rip Current,,,A formation of water flow in a seaward direction generated by wave action and local topography nearshore. Shallow depressions in the sea floor or breaks in a bar will channel receding water at high velocity away from shore and through the surf zone after onshore wave action.
W,,,,,,,h1.18.3,Current,Wave-driven Current,Undertow,,,Seaward-directed current generated by water that is receding from the shoreline after wave run up.
W,,,,,,,h1.19,Current,Wind-driven Current,,,,"Current caused by wind shear as distinguished by those caused by density differences, which result in thermohaline circulation. Though only a portion of the oceans are exposed to wind energy, winds are responsible for the great ocean gyres, dominant features of ocean circulation."
W,,,,,,,h2,Front,,,,,"Front Hydroforms are linear features formed at the conjunction of two or more water masses with different properties. Fronts are formed in many different ways when two water masses juxtapose. The front itself becomes a third water feature, and it has several distinctive properties of its own, including current speed and direction, physicochemical properties derived from the two merging water masses, sharp gradients in properties (such as salinity, temperature, nutrients and water clarity) and an accumulation of matter and biota. In estuaries, fronts can occur at the boundaries of horizontal layers between fresher upper layers and saltier bottom waters; in the ocean, fronts can occur between the upper mixed layer and lower layers."
W,,,,,,,h2.1,Front,Coastal Upwelling Front,,,,A frontal interface where a nearshore upwelling occurs due to local turbulent mixing. The upwelling front develops between the upwelling water and the coastal water mass.
W,,,,,,,h2.2,Front,Shelf-break Front,,,,"Frontal formations where cross-shelf waters encounter slope waters from the deeper oceans, often associated with upwelling. The seasonally transitional features are sites of high temperature, salinity and density gradients and often of high productivity where deep upwelled water contributes high nutrients."
W,,,,,,,h2.3,Front,Tidal Front,,,,"A front created by the linear convergence of two water masses brought into juxtaposition by tidal action. Generally the two masses will have differential characteristics such as temperature, density, and often of color and productivity. Fronts can be maintained as distinct due to these differences, which inhibit mixing across a density barrier. There is often strong vertical mixing on either side of the front, producing upwelling and aggregations of biota feeding on the material grown in situ or accumulated at the front."
W,,,,,,,h3,Water Mass,,,,,"The Water Mass Hydroform Class refers to a parcel of water with homogeneous properties (e.g., chemical, physical). If no other hydroform applies (or sufficient information is not available to classify the hydroform), the default would be a water mass that describes the general properties of the parcel. Any physicochemical property (or properties) can define a water mass. Common water mass types are those of homogeneous salinity, temperature or density—or a combination of those properties. The properties of a water mass generally change relatively slowly, because the factors that created and constrain the homogeneity tend to be buffered by the inertial properties of water itself. Thermal mass of water, for example, means that the water temperature will change much more slowly than air temperature. Non-conservative properties (such as nutrient concentration or pH) can change much more quickly, because biological processes can alter them."
W,,,,,,,h3.1,Water Mass,Background Mesoscale Field,,,,A water mass characterized by organized ocean-surface currents formed by coupled eddies (at the mesoscale length scale); responsible for much of water movement on the ocean surface.
W,,,,,,,h3.2,Water Mass,Fumarole Plume,,,,A plume of hot gases venting from the sea bottom associated with volcanic or tectonic activity from cracks in the Earth's crust; often a site of significant chemoautotrophic activity.
W,,,,,,,h3.3,Water Mass,Hydrothermal Plume,,,,"A discharge of hot fluids from sea-bottom vents associated with volcanic or tectonic activity. The fluids are often laden with high concentrations of minerals, which impart either a dark—even black—color or a white color. These minerals precipitate readily out of supersaturation."
W,,,,,,,h3.3.1,Water Mass,Hydrothermal Plume,Detached Hydrothermal Plume,,,"A parcel of hot, mineral rich water that has become detached from its source and forms a persistent lens within the water column."
W,,,,,,,h3.4,Water Mass,Ice,,,,"Frozen form of water, which is less dense than liquid water; ice floats on the surface of liquid water, sometimes extending into deep water zones. This property drives a number of important biological and physical processes in the ocean, including preventing freezing of the ocean to the bottom. Ice either floats on—or forms a solid cover on—the underlying water, which isolates atmospheric input for the duration of cover. Nonetheless, strong circulation and water motion occurs in the aquatic system under the ice (driven by advection of adjacent water masses or thermal convection). Because freshwater freezes at a higher temperature than salt water, surface freezing of the ocean concentrates salt brine in the liquid water below the ice. Ice formation and ice cover maintenance is relatively stable in both spatial and temporal terms, determined by relative air and water temperatures, velocity of water movements, and geomorphology of the setting."
W,,,,,,,h3.4.1,Water Mass,Ice,Drift Ice,,,Ice that floats freely on the sea surface.
W,,,,,,,h3.4.2,Water Mass,Ice,Fast Ice,,,"Ice that is attached to a land mass such as the coast or, in shallow water, the sea floor."
W,,,,,,,h3.4.3,Water Mass,Ice,Frazil or Grease Ice,,,"Ice formation that develops when super-cooled water is turbulently mixed, permitting development of small ice crystals which continually fragment and break up without forming ice cover. Over time a slushy suspension of increasing density forms on the surface of the water. In quiet conditions frazil crystals can freeze together to form a continuous thin sheet of young ice."
W,,,,,,,h3.4.4,Water Mass,Ice,Ice Field,,,Expanse of ice greater in size than an ice floe (≥10 kilometers in any dimension).
W,,,,,,,h3.4.5,Water Mass,Ice,Ice Floe,,,Large floating ice chunk less than 10 kilometers on its longest axis.
W,,,,,,,h3.4.6,Water Mass,Ice,Pack Ice,,,"Accumulation of drift ice into a large floating mass, often against a continental shoreline."

W,,,,,,,h3.4.8,Water Mass,Ice,Polnya,,,"An area of open, liquid seawater surrounded by ice."
W,,,,,,,h3.5,Water Mass,Mesoscale Lens,,,,"A trapped, homogeneous parcel of water lying within (or atop) larger ocean fields due to density differences. These hydroforms are 30 - 300 kilometers in size."
W,,,,,,,h3.5.1,Water Mass,Mesoscale Lens,River/Estuary Plume,,,"Formation of water resulting from the discharge of low-salinity water into marine waters of the ocean, forming a distinct layer of water on top of the seawater due to its lower density. The plume can extend for many kilometers and persist for months after the freshwater flow has stopped before being entrained into the seawater. These plumes are typically higher in nutrients, turbidity and productivity than the surrounding seawater and can gradually deliver those water quality characteristics to the adjacent ocean water."
W,,,,,,,h3.5.2,Water Mass,Mesoscale Lens,Meddy,,,"A lens of water that enters the eastern Atlantic from the Mediterranean Sea, flows down the Continental slope and pinches off at the depth of neutral buoyancy, about 1,000 meters.

W,,,,,,,h3.7,Water Mass,Winter Water Mass,,,,"The mass of water produced—and introduced to oceans—as a result of melting winter ice formations. These water masses tend to be fresher than surrounding waters, and they often flow over the denser salt water."
W,,,,,,,h4,Wave,,,,,"The Wave Hydroform Class is a propagation of energy that moves through the water, causing a vertical, oscillatory motion with characteristic wavelength, amplitude, and celerity. Waves are of several types: internal, standing, and surface. Each type of wave propagates energy and impacts the waters, substrate, and biota that it contacts. Waves are initiated by an energy source (such as wind, landslides, earthquakes, or volcanic eruptions), and they can occur at any depth in the water column. Wave energy varies depending on type and intensity of energy input; the wave regime can change on hourly timescales."

W,,,,,,,h4.6,Wave,Internal Wave,,,,"A wave that propagates along a density surface within the water column, below the water's surface."
W,,,,,,,h4.7,Wave,Seiche,,,,"A long-period, standing wave that creates an oscillatory sloshing of water within an enclosed water body. This is due to wind or pressure effects that cause water motions that resonate with the length scale of the water body."
W,,,,,,,h4.8,Wave,Storm Surge,,,,"A propagation of water associated with intense meteorological and wind activity such as a tropical storm. The surge of water from deep into shallow waters and onto land is caused by wind forcing in the forward, shoreward direction and by pressure differential within a cyclonic storm that positions extreme low pressure over a section of ocean, permitting tides to rise above normal range."
W,,,,,,,h4.9,Wave,Surf Zone,,,,"Zone with incipient wave breaks, which are the result of an increase in the steepness of the wave as the water depth decreases. The surf zone is the region extending from the seaward boundary of wave breaking to the limit of wave uprush. The surf zone is the specific subset of the wave hydroform where waves are breaking against a shoreline. This relatively narrow area occurs when waves encounter bottom friction and break, forming a region of high turbulence, mixing, and intense energy. This occurrence affects biota in the water column, as well as bottom and shore substrates and biota. The surf zone is highly variable temporally and spatially in extent, energy characteristics, and physicochemical properties; this variability is due to the tight coupling between the water column and the substrate it impacts. In areas of soft sediments, high turbidity can result. Benthic biota (such as diatom mats) can be mixed into the water column, imparting its photosynthetic parameters to the water column and elevating water-column productivity. Nutrients can also be mixed from disturbed sediments into the water column, elevating concentrations there."
W,,,,,,,h4.10,Wave,Surface Wave,,,,"A wave generated by energy input from sources such as wind, landslides, tidal action, or current action, and that moves along the surface of the ocean."
W,,,,,,,h4.11,Wave,Surface Wind Wave,,,,"A surface wave generated by direct wind action on the water's surface producing shear, piling up water in the direction of the wind and generating a wave."
W,,,,,,,h4.12,Wave,Surface Swell,,,,A surface gravity wave propagating into an area from a distant source of energy/disturbance and that is not caused by direct local action of the wind.
W,,,,,,,h4.13,Wave,Tsunami,,,,"A large long-wavelength (tens or hundreds of kilometers) ocean wave that is generated by a powerful undersea disturbance such as a landslide, earthquake, or volcano. The wave is nearly imperceptible in the open ocean but as it approaches land, it can reach heights of many tens of meters. They can have enormous destructive impact on the coast (and inland), as well as the biology of the nearshore zone."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f1,Benthic Boundary Layer,The layer formed at the interface between the lower water column and the benthic substrate.
W,,,,,,,,,,,f2,Boundary Layer,Layer formed at the interface between water and another water mass (or solid interface) where frictional shear forces on water motion cause exponential damping of movement with proximity to the interface.
W,,,,,,,,,,,f3,Chlorophyll Maximum,"A feature in deeper water columns (often in the ocean), where phytoplankton production is locally high at depths along a surface of nutrient (nitrate) entrainment from lower-water layers."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f4,Chlorophyll Minimum,A layer of low chlorophyll—and hence phytoplankton—concentration (relative to adjacent waters) due to highly concentrated grazing activity.
W,,,,,,,,,,,f5,Drifting Fine Woody Debris,"Aggregations of floating or suspended fine woody material such as small tree branches, husks or fibrous seeds, with a median particle size < 64 millimeters."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f6,Drifting Herbaceous Debris,"Floating or suspended detached, decaying herbaceous plant matter such as leaves, forbs or grasses, including deciduous leaves or needles, palm leaves, seagrass debris, <i>Spartina</i> debris."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f7,Drifting Trees,"Floating or suspended large dead trees or very large branches, with a median particle size of greater than 4,096 millimeters."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f8,Drifting Woody Debris,"Floating or suspended detached large branches with a median particle size of 64 millimeters to < 256 millimeters such as Mangrove branches, coconut rafts."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f9,Euphotic Zone,The zone of the water column that is sufficiently illuminated for photosynthesis to occur.
W,,,,,,,,,,,f10,Halocline,"The zone of rapid salinity change with depth in the water column, often separating two layers of different, homogeneous salinity. As the density of water changes with salinity, the halocline presents a barrier to vertical circulation and enhances water column stability"
W,,,,,,,,,,,f11,Lens,A homogeneous parcel of water that—by composition—maintains coherence within water of different properties. Often a freshwater lens will sit perched atop saline ocean waters for long periods.
W,,,,,,,,,,,f12,Lysocline,"The depth in the ocean at which calcium dissolution increases due to increased pressure. This depth is around 4,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean and 5,000 meters in the Atlantic Ocean, owing to differences in temperature and chemistry. Below this depth, the precipitation of calcium carbonate decreases rapidly to the point where no calcite is deposited."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f13,Marine Snow Aggregation,"A concentration of organic material in the ocean water column. Composed of a mix of mineral, dead organic materials, and—sometimes—a rich microbial community.  In this feature small particles aggregate through attractive ionic forces and then begin to fall through the water column."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f14,Microlayer,"Any extremely thin layer of material, nutrients, organisms or specific properties that exists on or in the water column. The microlayer can be a surface film or at depth and often refers to a microbial film."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f15,Nepheloid Layer,"Layer of water that contains a high concentration of silt and sediment—usually at the benthic-water column interface. This layer can be nearly a fluid mud. In the deep oceans, the layer can be hundreds of meters thick; in shallower waters with less fine sediments, it can be much thinner (only a few centimeters in places) or absent. Thickness is determined by substrate composition and current shear."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f16,Neustonic Layer,"Layer of biota that lives at the surface of the water. These organisms are either positively buoyant, maintain position by taking advantage of surface tension, or live on other biotic or abiotic material. Epineuston floats atop the water, hyponeuston lives just under the surface."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f17,Nutrient Maximum,A layer or region in the water column that has high concentrations of a particular nutrient or nutrients due either to biological transformation or to abiotic factors such as advection or entrainment from adjacent water masses.
W,,,,,,,,,,,f18,Nutrient Minimum,"A layer in the ocean where net nutrient accumulation is at a minimum, often due to a locus of high biological activity drawing down nutrient stocks."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f19,Nutricline,"The zone of rapid nutrient change with depth in the water column, often as a result of entrainment of water from a lower depth that is higher in concentration of a particular nutrient. The nutricline can be a rich source of a limiting nutrient and hence, the site of intense microbial or photosynthetic activity."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f20,Oxygen Maximum,"A layer in the ocean where oxygen concentration is at a minimum, often due to a locus of high respiratory activity, notably microbial."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f21,Oxygen Minimum,"Region in the water column where oxygen is reduced (relative to surrounding waters) due to high respiration rates, usually associated with high concentrations of organic matter."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f22,Oxycline,"Zone in the water column where oxygen concentration changes rapidly with depth, often as a result of biological or abiotic processes that consume oxygen. Deep, bottom water that contains no photosynthetic organisms—yet receives much deposited organic matter—can generate both high respiration rates and extremely low oxygen concentrations. The transition layer between hypoxic bottom water and oxygenated surface water is the oxycline."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f23,Sea Foam,"Sea foam is produced by turbulent mixing and agitation of surface waters, enhanced by high concentrations of dissolved organic matter (DOM)."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f24,Seep,"Area on the ocean bottom where fluid slowly emerges. Cold seeps are usually at the continental margins; waters in these seeps are often highly concentrated in minerals and dissolved gases, such as hydrogen sulfide, methane, and hydrogen. Cold-fluid seeps and oil seeps are sources of energy for chemoautotrophic communities of bacteria and archaea, which in turn support communities of clams, mussels and vestimentiferan tubeworms."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f25,Surface Film,"Thin layer of materials and biota that exist on the surface of the water, often only a few microns thick. The surface film can contain a rich microbial community that consumes the material that concentrated in the film. Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) is concentrated up to five times in the surface microlayer. These films are often aggregated and concentrated at frontal convergences of two water masses and can lead to formation of a rich community that feeds on the material."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f26,Surface Mixed Layer,The layer of water at the ocean surface that is mixed by wind. Water of homogeneous density is easily mixed to a depth determined by the intensity of wind shear and density of the water. Often wind mixing of the surface occurs to the pycnocline depth where density increases rapidly. The mixed layer depth is an important determinant of the extent and intensity of photosynthetic production as plankton cells are mixed through the vertical light gradient.
W,,,,,,,,,,,f27,Thermocline,"The zone of rapid temperature change with depth in the water column, often separating two layers of different, homogeneous temperature. As the density of water changes with temperature, the thermocline presents a barrier to vertical circulation and enhances water column stability."
W,,,,,,,,,,,f28,Turbidity Maximum,"Region in an estuary where turbidity is high, due to concentration of particulates in the water column. This occurs as a result of the increasing ionic strength of the water from the introduction of salt in the downstream direction (generally at around areas with a salinity of 5), which causes particle aggregation. This process is enhanced by the mixing regime particular to this upper estuary region, in which countercurrent flows from the salt wedge are entrained into the seaward-flowing, upper-water layer. As particles settle out of the upper layer, they are carried upstream in the lower layer and so circulate within a zone of maximum turbidity."
