G,t1,Abyssal Plain,,,,,,,,,,,"A flat region of the deep ocean floor (with a slope less than 1:1,000) that was formed by the deposition of pelagic and gravity-current sediments, which obscure the pre-existing topography. Vast areas of the ocean floor fall within this setting, which can be subdivided into smaller basins based on regional topography."
G,t2,Convergent Active Continental Margin,,,,,,,,,,,"Intense areas of active magmatism, where the oceanic lithosphere is subducted beneath the continental lithosphere. This results in chains of volcanoes near the continental margin; the leading edge of the continental plate is usually studded with steep mountain ranges."
G,t3,Divergent Active Continental Margin,,,,,,,,,,,Areas where tensional tectonic forces result in the crustal rocks being stretched and—ultimately—split apart or rifted. These areas are marked by subsidence and a continental rise.
G,t4,Fracture Zone,,,,,,,,,,,An elongate zone of unusually irregular topography (on the deep seafloor) that often separates basins and regions of different depths; fracture zones commonly follow (and extend beyond) offsets of the mid-ocean ridge.
G,t5,Spreading Center,,,,,,,,,,,"Spreading centers are areas where tectonic plates are moving apart, allowing new oceanic crust to reach the surface of the sea floor."
G,t6,Mid-Ocean Ridge,,,,,,,,,,,"An extremely large, global spreading center. The mid-ocean ridge is a continuous, seismically active, median mountain range extending through the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indian, and South Pacific Oceans. It is a broad, fractured swell with a central rift valley and usually extremely rugged topography. The ridge is 1-3 kilometers in height, about 1,500 kilometers in width, and over 84,000 kilometers in length. Sections of this feature are sometimes named based on the ocean region in which this feature occur (for example, Mid-Atlantic Ridge)."
G,t7,Passive Continental Margin,,,,,,,,,,,"The transition between oceanic and continental crust that is not an active plate margin. This feature was constructed by sedimentation above an ancient rift, now marked by transitional crust. Major tectonic movement is broad, whereas regional vertical adjustment, earthquakes, and volcanic activity are minor and local."
G,t8,Transform Continental Margin,,,,,,,,,,,A feature defined by the transform fault that develops during continental rifting. These margins differ from rifted or passive margins in two key ways; they have a narrow continental shelf (less than 30 kilometers) and a steep ocean-continent transition zone (Keary et al. 2009).
G,t9,Tectonic Trench,,,,,,,,,,,"A narrow, elongate depression of the deep seafloor associated with a subduction zone. These can be oriented parallel to a volcanic arc and are commonly aligned with the edge of the adjacent continent, between the continental margin and the abyssal hills. Trenches are commonly greater than 2 kilometers deeper than the surrounding ocean floor, and they may be thousands of kilometers long."
G,,,p1,Abyssal/Submarine Fan,,,,,,,,,"A low, outspread, relatively flat-to-gently sloping mass of loose material—shaped like an open fan or a segment of a cone—deposited by a flow of water at the place where it issues from a narrower or steeper-gradient area into a broader area, valley, flat, or other feature. Abyssal fans form at the mouths of submarine canyons, and fans are also the result of turbidities (that is, gravity-driven, underwater avalanches)."
G,,,p2,Barrier Reef,,,,,,,,,"A long, narrow coral reef, roughly parallel to the shore and separated from it by a lagoon of considerable depth and width. This reef may enclose a volcanic island (either wholly or in part), or it may lie a great distance from a continental coast (such as the Great Barrier Reef). Generally, barrier reefs follow the coasts for long distances—often with short interruptions that are called passes or channels. Three principle examples of this type of feature are Australia's Great Barrier Reef, the New Caledonia Barrier Reef, and the Meso-American Barrier Reef system—although similar features exist elsewhere."
G,,,p3,Bight,,,,,,,,,"A broad bend or curve in a generally open coast. Examples include the South Atlantic Bight and the Southern California Bight. These are distinguished from Embayment/Bays by the shallower angle between the apex of the bight and the adjacent coasts, although the term <i>Bay</i> has been used to name these features (e.g., Bay of Campeche)."
G,,,p4,Borderland,,,,,,,,,"An area of the continental margin (between the shoreline and the continental slope) that is topographically more complex than the continental shelf. This feature is characterized by ridges and basins, some of which are below the depth of the continental shelf."
G,,,p5,Continental/Island Rise,,,,,,,,,An area that lies at the deepest part of a continental or island margin between the continental slope and the abyssal plain. The rise is a gentle incline (with slopes of 0.5° to 1°) and it has generally smooth topography—although it may bear submarine canyons.
G,,,p6,Continental/Island Shelf,,,,,,,,,"That part of the continental margin that is between the shoreline and the continental slope (or a depth or 200 meters when there is no noticeable continental slope); it is characterized by its very gentle slope of 0.1°. Island shelves are analogous to the continental shelves, but surround islands."
G,,,p7,Continental/Island Shore Complex,,,,,,,,,"This feature includes the land-water interface zone and contains geoforms across a diversity of scales. For CMECS, the supratidal zone forms the landward limit of geoforms found within the shore complex setting. This setting does not include the land-water interface along tidal rivers that may extend a considerable distance inland."
G,,,p8,Continental/Island Slope,,,,,,,,,"That part of the continental margin that is between the continental shelf and the continental rise (if there is one); it is characterized by its relatively steep slope of 1.5 - 6°. Island slopes are analogous to the continental slopes, but occur around islands."
G,,,p9,Embayment/Bay,,,,,,,,,"A water body with some level of enclosure by land at different spatial scales. These can be wide, curving indentations in the coast, arms of the sea, or bodies of water almost surrounded by land. These features can be small—with considerable freshwater and terrestrial influence—or large and generally oceanic in character."
G,,,p10,Fjord,,,,,,,,,"A long, narrow, glacially eroded inlet or arm of the sea. They are often U-shaped, steep-walled, and deep. Because of their depth, they tend to have low surface-area-to-volume ratios. They have moderate watershed-to-water-area ratios and low-to-moderate riverine inputs. Fjords often have a geologic sill formation at the seaward end caused by glacial action. This morphology—combined with a low exchange of bottom waters with the ocean—can result in formation of hypoxic bottom waters."
G,,,p11,Inland/Enclosed Sea,,,,,,,,,"A large, water body almost completely surrounded by land. Salinities range from fresh through marine. The term <i>inland</i> is used to describe situations where the water body is connected to an adjacent large water body by a narrow strait, channel, canal, or river. Examples of this type of setting are the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The Great Lakes, due to their connectivity to the Atlantic Ocean via the St. Lawrence River also fall into this category."
G,,,p12,Lagoonal Estuary,,,,,,,,,"This class of estuary tends to be shallow, highly enclosed, and have reduced exchange with the ocean. They often experience high evaporation, and they tend to be quiescent in terms of wind, current, and wave energy. Lagoonal estuaries usually have a very high surface-to-volume ratio, a low-to-moderate watershed-to-water-area ratio, and can have a high wetland-to-water ratio. The flushing times tend to be long relative to riverine estuaries and embayments because the restricted exchange with the marine-end member and the reduced river input lengthen residence times. As such, there tends to be more benthic-pelagic interaction, enhanced by generally shallow bathymetry. Additionally, exchange with surrounding landscapes (often riparian wetland and palustrine systems) tends to be enhanced and more highly coupled than in other types of estuaries.<br/><br/>Occasionally, a lagoon may be produced by the temporary sealing of a river estuary by a barrier. Such lagoons are usually seasonal and exist until the river breaches the barrier; these lagoons occur in regions of low or sporadic rainfall."
G,,,p13,Major River Delta,,,,,,,,,"The nearly flat, alluvial tract of land at the mouth of a river, which commonly forms a triangular or fan-shaped plain. It is crossed by many distributaries, and the delta is the result of sediment accumulation from the river. Deltas are distinguished from alluvial fans by their flatter slope. Examples of this feature include the Mississippi Delta, the Nile Delta, and the Ganges Delta. All deltas are dynamic areas of mixed-water flow and salinity."
G,,,p14,Marine Basin Floor,,,,,,,,,"Basin floors refer broadly to the areas of the seafloor between the base of the continental margin (usually the foot of the continental rise) and the mid-ocean ridge. Occasionally, this large region is subdivided into smaller basins based on local bathymetry."
G,,,p15,Ocean Bank/Plateau,,,,,,,,,"A mound-like or ridge-like elevated area on the seafloor; it may have a modest-to-substantial extent. Although submerged, this feature can reach close to sea level (e.g., Bahama Banks)."
G,,,p16,Riverine Estuary,,,,,,,,,"This class of estuary tends to be linear and seasonally turbid (especially in upper reaches), and it can be subjected to high current speeds. These estuaries are sedimentary and depositional, so they may be associated with a delta, bar, barrier island, and other depositional features. These estuaries also tend to be highly flushed (with a wide and variable salinity range) and seasonally stratified. Riverine estuaries have moderate surface-to-volume ratios with a high watershed-to-water-area ratio—and they can have very high wetland-to-water-area ratios as well. These estuaries are often characterized by a V-shaped channel configuration and a salt wedge.<br/><br/>High inputs of land drainage can promote increased primary productivity, which may be confined to the water column in the upper reach, due to low transparency in the water column. Surrounding wetlands may be extensive and healthy, given the sediment supply and nutrient input. This marsh perimeter may be important in taking up the excess nutrients that are introduced to the system. Physically, the system may tend to be stratified during periods of high riverine input, and the input of marine waters may be enhanced by countercurrent flow."
G,,,p17,Shelf Basin,,,,,,,,,Basins occurring on the continental shelf formed by offshore faulting activity.
G,,,p18,Shelf Break,,,,,,,,,The slope discontinuity (rapid change in gradient) of 3° or greater that occurs at the outer edge of the continental shelf. This boundary generally occurs at a depth between 100-200 meters and forms the boundary between the Marine Offshore and Oceanic Subsystems.
G,,,p19,Sound,,,,,,,,,"(a) A relatively long, narrow waterway connecting two larger bodies of water (or two parts of the same water body), or an arm of the sea forming a channel between the mainland and an island (e.g., Puget Sound, WA). A sound is generally wider and more extensive than a strait. (b) A long, large, rather broad inlet of the ocean, which generally extends parallel to the coast (e.g., Long Island Sound, NY)."
G,,,p20,Submarine Canyon,,,,,,,,,"A general term for all linear, steep-sided valleys on the seafloor. These canyons can be associated with terrestrial or nearshore river inputs, such as in the Hudson or Mississippi canyons."
G,,,p21,Trench,,,,,,,,,"Trenches in the physiographic setting subcomponent occur at a smaller spatial scale than the hemispheric-sized trenches in the tectonic setting. Both types of trenches share similar morphology, but physiographic setting Trenches are not necessarily associated with plate subduction."
G,,,,,g1,Geologic,,,,,,,"Geologic geoforms are formed by the abiotic processes of uplift, erosion, volcanism, deposition, fluid seepage, and material movement. Uplift may be a result of local and regional seismic and tectonic processes. Waves, currents, wind, chemical dissolution, seismic motion, and chemical precipitation all contribute to these geoforms and give them their distinctive qualities."
G,,,,,g1.1,Geologic,Apron,X,,,,,"An extensive, subaqueous, blanket-like deposit of alluvial, unconsolidated material that is derived from an identifiable source and deposited at the base of a mountain or seamount."
G,,,,,g1.2,Geologic,Bank,X,,,,,"An elevated area above the surrounding seafloor that rises near the surface. Banks generally are low-relief features, of modest-to-substantial extent, that normally remain submerged. They may have a variety of shapes and may show signs of erosion resulting from exposure during periods of lower sea level. Banks tend to occur on the continental shelf. Banks differ from shoals in having greater size and temporal persistence. The Geoform Bank differs from the Coral Reef Zone modifier Bank based on its geologic origin."
G,,,,,g1.3,Geologic,Bar,X,X,,,,"A relatively shallow place (in a stream, lake, sea, or other body of water) that is typically a submerged ridge, or bank consisting of (or covered) by sand or other unconsolidated material—but may also be composed of rock or other material (modified from Jackson 1997)."
G,,,,,g1.3.1,Geologic,Bar,,,Bay Mouth Bar,X,,"A bar of sand or gravel extending partially or entirely across the mouth of a bay. It usually connects two headlands, thus straightening the coast."
G,,,,,g1.3.2,Geologic,Bar,,,Longshore Bar,X,,"A low sand ridge, built chiefly by wave action, occurring at some distance from and generally parallel with the shoreline, being submerged at least by high tides, and typically separated from the beach by an intervening trough."
G,,,,,g1.3.3,Geologic,Bar,,,Point Bar,,X,"Low, arcuate, subaerial ridges of sand developed adjacent to an inlet and formed by the lateral accretion or movement of the channel."
G,,,,,g1.3.4,Geologic,Bar,,,Relict Longshore Bar,,X,"A narrow, elongate, coarse-textured ridge that once rose near to, or barely above, a pluvial or glacial lake or other body of water and extended generally parallel to the shore but was separated from it by an intervening trough or lagoon; both the bar and lagoon are now relict features (Jackson 1997)."
G,,,,,g1.4,Geologic,Basin,X,,,,,General term for an area of the seafloor or land surface that lies below the surrounding bottom or terrain elevation. They are normally areas of low relief.
G,,,,,g1.5,Geologic,Beach,X,X,,,,"A gently sloping zone formed by unconsolidated material at the shoreline, typically with a concave profile. This zone extends landward from the low-water line to either (a) the place where there is a definite change in material or physiographic form (such as a cliff) or (b) the line of permanent vegetation. Only those portions of the beach within the splash zone would be within the CMECS system; areas of the beach further inland are terrestrial systems."
G,,,,,g1.5.1,Geologic,Beach,,,Barrier Beach,X,X,"A narrow, elongate, coarse-textured, intertidal, sloping landform that is generally parallel with the beach ridge component of the barrier island (or a spit), and which is adjacent to the ocean (Jackson 1997; Peterson 1981)."
G,,,,,g1.5.2,Geologic,Beach,,,Mainland Beach,X,X,"Any beach that is connected to the mainland, whether fronting bluffs, dunes, or extensive marshes."
G,,,,,g1.5.3,Geologic,Beach,,,Pocket Beach,,X,"A small beach between two headlands. Because of this isolation, there is very little—or no—exchange of sediment between the pocket beach and the adjacent shorelines."
G,,,,,g1.5.4,Geologic,Beach,,,Tide-Modified Beach,X,X,"Beaches that occur in areas of high tide range (3-15 times the wave height) and usually lower waves (less than 0.3 meter).

G,,,,,g1.7,Geologic,Boulder Field,X,,,,,"An area dominated by large, boulder-sized (256 millimeters - 4,096 millimeters) stones or pieces of rock. These can occur below cliffs or at the foot of steep slopes or canyons, where they are the result of depositional processes. These fields can also occur as the result of currents that have removed the finer sediments."
G,,,,,g1.8,Geologic,Cave,,X,,,,A natural passage extending beneath the earth's surface.
G,,,,,g1.9,Geologic,Channel,X,X,,,,"A general term for a linear or sinuous depression on an otherwise more flat area (for example, a valley- or groove-like feature through which water flows). This is a very broad term that is often used in connection with other terms to provide more meaning."

G,,,,,g1.9.2,Geologic,Channel,,,Sand Channel,,X,"These are narrow passages between, and in association with, pavement formations commonly oriented perpendicular to the shore. The bottoms of these channels normally consist of sand or other unconsolidated mineral substrates. They occur in areas of moderate wave surge and have low vertical relief as compared to spur-and-groove formations."
G,,,,,g1.9.3,Geologic,Channel,,,Slough,X,,"(a) A sluggish body of water in a tidal flat, bottomland, or coastal marshland; may also be called bayous or oxbows. (b) A sluggish channel of water (such as a side channel of a river) in which water flows slowly through either low, swampy ground (such as along the Columbia River) or a section of an abandoned river channel (which may contain stagnant water) that occurs in a flood plain or delta."

G,,,,,g1.11.3,Geologic,Delta,X,X,,,,"A landform made by a stream flowing through glacial ice and then depositing material as it enters a lake or pond at the end (or terminus) of the glacier. This delta is distinctive because it has been sorted by the action of the stream. This landform may often be observed after the glacier has melted. As the glacier melts, the edges of the delta may subside (as ice under it melts); additionally, glacial till may be deposited in the lateral or side area of the delta from the melting glacier."
G,,,,,g1.12,Geologic,Delta,,,Glacial (Kame) Delta,X,,"The low, nearly flat, alluvial tract of land at (or near) the mouth of a river. Deltas commonly form a triangular or fan-shaped plain of considerable area, which is crossed by many distributaries of the main river; deltas may extend beyond the general trend of the coast, and occur as a result of the accumulation of river sediment supplied in such quantities that it is not removed by tides, waves, and currents."
G,,,,,g1.12.1,Geologic,Delta,,,Ebb Tidal Delta,,X,"A largely subaqueous (although sometimes intertidal), crudely fan-shaped delta with sand-sized sediment, which has been formed on the seaward side of a tidal inlet (modified from Boothroyd et al. 1985; Davis 1994; Ritter, Kochel, and Miller 1995)."

G,,,,,g1.17,Geologic,Drumlin,,X,,,,"Drumlins are products of the streamline (laminar) flow of glaciers, which molded the subglacial floor through a combination of erosion and deposition. A drumlin is a low, smooth, elongated-oval hill, mound, or ridge of compact till, which has a core of bedrock or drift. A drumlin usually has a blunt nose facing the direction from which the ice approached, and a gentler slope tapering in the other direction. The longest axis is parallel to the general direction of glacier flow."

G,,,,,g1.21.1,Geologic,Fan,,,Alluvial Fan,X,,"A low, outspread, relatively flat (or gently sloping) mass of loose rock material, shaped like an open fan or a segment of a cone. The rock material was deposited by flowing water where it issues from a narrow valley or where the gradient abruptly changes. Alluvial fans are usually steeper than the surrounding surface."
G,,,,,g1.21.2,Geologic,Fan,,,Basin Floor Fan,X,,Deposition of submarine fans on the lower slope or basin floor; fan formation is associated with the erosion of canyons into the slope and the incision of fluvial valleys into the shelf. Siliciclastic sediment bypasses the shelf and slope through the valleys and canyons to feed the basin floor fan; sediment may be deposited at the mouth of a canyon or in an area widely separated from the canyon mouth—or a canyon may not be evident.
G,,,,,g1.21.3,Geologic,Fan,,,Shoreline Fan,X,,A prograding shoreline formed where an alluvial fan is built out into a lake or sea.
G,,,,,g1.21.4,Geologic,Fan,,,Washover Fan,X,X,"A fan-like landform of sand that washed over a barrier island or spit during a storm, and then deposited sand on the landward side. Washover fans can be small and completely subaerial—or they can be quite large and include subaqueous margins that extend into adjacent lagoons or estuaries.

G,,,,,g1.22.6,Geologic,Flat,,,Washover Fan Flat,X,,"A gently sloping, fan-like, subaqueous landform created by overwash from storm surges that transports sediment from the seaward side to the landward side of a barrier island (Jackson 1997). Sediment is carried through temporary overwash channels that cut through the dune complex on the barrier spit (Fisher and Simpson 1979; Boothroyd et al. 1985; Davis 1994) and spill out onto the lagoon-side platform, where they coalesce to form a broad belt. Also called Storm-Surge Platform Flat (Boothroyd et al. 1985) and Washover Fan Apron (Jackson 1997)."
G,,,,,g1.22.7,Geologic,Flat,,,Wind Tidal Flat,X,,"A broad, low-lying, nearly level sand flat that is alternately flooded by ponded rainwater or inundated by wind-driven marine and estuarine waters. Salinity fluctuations and prolonged periods of exposure preclude establishment of most types of vegetation (except for mats of filamentous blue-green algae)."
G,,,,,g1.23,Geologic,Fluvio-Marine Deposit,X,X,,,,"Stratified materials (clay, silt, sand, or gravel) formed by both marine and fluvial processes, resulting from non-tidal sea-level fluctuations, subsidence, and/or stream migration (e.g., materials originally deposited in a nearshore environment and subsequently reworked by fluvial processes as the sea level fell)."
G,,,,,g1.24,Geologic,Fracture,X,X,,,,A crack or split formed in a rock or bedrock as a result of local erosion or rock stress; they are not due to tectonic actions (which form larger faults and fracture zones).

The continually (or intermittently) submerged portions of features attract vagile fauna and provide attachment surfaces for plants and sessile animals. These features can also provide shelter from predators and prevailing current, and they can support niche communities that increase overall biodiversity. However, these structures can also have negative effects (such as altering natural hydrodynamic patterns, interfering with animal movement, and increasing contaminant loading into nearshore areas), and thus are often of interest to resource managers.<br/><br/>The same relationship between Level 1 and Level 2 geoforms prevails in this origin type as in the geologic and biogenic categories; however, due to the complexity of some of the anthropogenic structures, many more Level 2 units may be present in a single Level 1 geoform. Besides physical structures, features that are the result of human activity (such as scars and trawl marks) are included among the anthropogenic geoforms."
G,,,,,g3.1,Anthropogenic,Aquaculture Structure,X,X,,,,"These structures can take many forms: lines suspended over the sediment, floating wooden frameworks sub-tidal structures attached to the benthos such as wooden piers and platforms, and pens and enclosures (both at the surface and submerged). These structures are associated with the cultivation of fish, crustaceans, and shellfish for human use or consumption. They may be integrated into shallow water bays and ponds, or they may be deployed in deeper water. Due to their structural aspects, they can be attractive to fish and other animals. They are often sources of nutrients and, thus, have impacts on the surrounding ecology."

G,,,,,g3.35,Anthropogenic,Trash Aggregation,X,X,,,,"Aggregations of submerged, floating or suspended trash. These may be loose and mobile as when floating at the water's surface or consolidated by sediment on the bottom or along shore. Trash aggregations may be the result of local storm or seismic events such as floods or tsunamis. Trash aggregations can also form over long periods due to the action of large gyres and currents as in the mid-Pacific Ocean."
G,,,,,g3.36,Anthropogenic,Wharf,,X,,,,"A structure on the shore of a harbor where ships may dock to load and unload cargo or passengers. A wharf is usually a fixed platform, often on pilings. Smaller and more modern wharves are sometimes built on flotation devices (pontoons) to keep them at the same level as the ship—even during changing tides. Wharves form attachment surfaces for shellfish and sessile epifauna, and they are common aggregation points for fish. Also, wharves are often locations where contaminants are introduced into the environment (through spills or waste disposal)."
G,,,,,g3.37,Anthropogenic,Wind Energy Structure,,X,,,,"Structures deployed in the marine environment in order to produce energy from the wind. These structures often consist of piling, cabling supports, and associated anchoring devices."
