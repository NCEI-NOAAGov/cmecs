CSS01,,Community Successional Stage,Stage 0,"These oligozoic soft-sediment areas show little evidence of multi-cellular life; however, benthic samples that are retrieved and processed under magnification from Stage 0 stations will generally produce low numbers of small macrofauna or meiofauna. Multicellular fauna will not be obvious to the unassisted eye when examining sediment, and it will not be obvious in high-resolution images of the seafloor. Bacterial mats may be present. If examining sediment profile images, guidelines from Rhoads and Germano (1982, 1986) can be followed or the Nilsson-Rosenberg BHQ metrics (Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) can be used (BHQ values for Stage 0 will range from 0 to 1.99). No evidence of active bioturbation exists, and aRPD depths are typically < 2 millimeters."
CSS02,,,Stage 1,"These associations are inhabited by small opportunistic fauna (e.g., capitellids and spionids) in the upper centimeter of sediment. Larger fauna are not present, although juvenile individuals of larger species may occur. Names of small, opportunistic local species typical of Stage 1 are available in the regional literature. Surface expressions include small tubes (< 2 millimeters in diameter) of polychaetes or other fauna, or evidence of oligochaete burrowing activities. Subsurface evidence of either small worms or small burrow structures will primarily occur in the upper centimeter of sediment. If examining sediment profile images, guidelines from Rhoads and Germano (1982, 1986) can be followed or the Nilsson-Rosenberg BHQ metrics (Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) can be used (Stage 1 BHQ values will range from 2 to < 5). Bioturbation depths will be shallow, with an aRPD depth typically > 2 millimeters to < 2 centimeters."
CSS03,,,Stage 2,"Communities are characterized by fauna of intermediate sizes typically inhabiting the upper 2-4 centimeters of sediment. This stage is considered transitional and is often variable; in a percentage of samples it will be difficult to clearly distinguish Stage 2 from other stages within the continuous spectrum presented by natural environments. Regional literature identifying species typical of Stage 2 may be referenced. Surface evidence of Stage 2 communities includes openings to small burrows (defined as excavations with a lumen width < 1 centimeter) and the presence of mid-sized tube dwelling fauna (e.g., robust Ampelisca tube mats; tubes > 2 millimeters in diameter; or tubes longer than 30 millimeters if very thin). Subsurface evidence includes burrows of polychaetes or other fauna in the upper 2-4 centimeters of sediment, small shallow-dwelling opportunistic bivalves, and small feeding voids in the upper 4 centimeters of sediment. If examining sediment profile images, guidelines from Rhoads and Germano (1982, 1986) can be followed or the Nilsson-Rosenberg BHQ metrics (Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) can be used (BHQ for Stage 2 will range from 5 to 10)."
CSS04,,,Stage 3,"These communities are identified by larger, long-lived, deep burrowing fauna or by evidence of the activities of those fauna; burrowing activities typically extend deeper than 5 centimeters. Characteristic species vary among localities and among environments; species can be identified through regionally appropriate literature. Common surface expression may include very large tube-building fauna (> 3 millimeters in diameter or > 30 mm in length), larger fecal mounds, burrowing urchins or ophiuroids, pits or tunnel openings (e.g., crustacean excavations with a lumen width of > 1 centimeter), or large digging spoils associated with pits or tunnels. Subsurface characteristics include oxygenated or active faunal feeding voids at 5 centimeters or deeper, active tunnels (subsurface excavations with a lumen width of > 1 centimeter) at depth, or presence of large polychaetes or other fauna. Frequently, evidence of smaller, opportunistic fauna will also be present in Stage 3 communities; these fauna are not necessarily eliminated by larger fauna. If evaluating sediment profile images, guidelines from Rhoads and Germano (1982, 1986) can be followed, or the Nilsson-Rosenberg Benthic Habitat Quality (BHQ) metric (Nilsson and Rosenberg 1997, 2000) can be used (Stage 3 will have BHQ > 10). Extensive bioturbation will be evidenced by deep RPD and aRPD depths."
ICOS01,,Invertebrate Community Organism Size,Large Megafauna,"Benthic invertebrate communities that are dominated by organisms that typically reach a body size of > 3 to 10 centimeters in the smallest dimension (e.g., height, width), with this measurement not to include the length of slender, lateral protrusions (such as arms or tentacles)."
ICOS02,,,Megafauna,"Benthic invertebrate communities that are dominated by organisms that typically reach a body size of > 1 to 3 centimeters in the smallest dimension (e.g., height, width), with this measurement not to include the length of slender, lateral protrusions (such as arms or tentacles). These communities may be identified by evidence of these fauna (e.g., large mounds or pit or tunnel openings of > 1 to 3 centimeters)."
ICOS03,,,Large Macrofauna,Benthic invertebrate communities that are dominated by organisms with a body width (smallest dimension) of > 2 millimeters to 1 centimeter; living organisms larger than this size range are rare in these infaunal or epifaunal associations.
ICOS04,,,Small Macrofauna,Benthic invertebrate communities that are dominated by organisms with a body width (smallest dimension) of > 0.5 to 2 millimeters; living organisms larger than this size range are rare in these infaunal or epifaunal associations.
ICOS05,,,Meiofauna,"Benthic invertebrate communities that are dominated by organisms with a body width (smallest dimension) of 0.5 mm or less, that would typically pass through an 0.5 mm sieve but be retained on an 0.25 mm sieve. Living organisms larger than this size range are rare in the infaunal or epifaunal association; the modifier may be applied to any classification unit within Faunal Bed."

SD03,,,Floc,"A layer of very fine particles suspended in the water column just above firmer sediment. This is often most apparent with visual or imaging techniques, and may appear as a turbid or cloudy layer above a more defined sediment surface. This is one of several terms that are used in CMECS to describe the fluid consistency of substrates."
SD04,,,Fluid,"Substrate with high water content. When a palmful of sediment is squeezed in the hand, most or all flows through the fingers after full pressure (Schoeneberger et al. 2002). This is one of several terms that are used to describe the fluid consistency of substrates in CMECS."

SD06,,,Mobile,"Bedded sediments which regularly resuspend and/or move with local hydrodynamics due to the density, grain size, shape, and/or high water content of the sediment, or due to the higher hydrodynamic energy experienced in the local area. This term is used in CMECS to describe or predict behavior of substrates."
SD07,,,Non-Mobile,"Bedded sediments which do not regularly resuspend and/or move with local hydrodynamics due to the density, grain size, shape, and/or compaction (low water content) of the sediment particles, or due to the lower hydrodynamic energy experienced in the local area. This term is used in CMECS to describe or predict behavior of substrates."

SD15,,,Well-Mixed,"Different elements within a sample, observational unit, or reporting unit are well-mixed or poorly-sorted at the scale of the sample or unit. Well-mixed implies that elements or particles are completely and relatively evenly intermingled, e.g., Granule/Sand/Mud particles in an area with high bioturbation. This is one of several terms used in CMECS to describe unit variability. Note that CMECS does not use the equivalent geological term ""Poorly-Sorted"", because the descriptor may be used to describe distributions of non-geological features (such as biological communities or Geoform Component structures)."
SD16,,,Well-Sorted,"Different elements within a sample, observational unit, or reporting unit are separated into different areas at the scale of the sample or unit. Well-sorted implies that elements or particles are (or have been) separated and arranged in a non- haphazard manner, as an area of Coarse Sand adjacent to an area of Clay. This is one of several terms used in CMECS to describe unit variability."

CoE,,Co-occurring Elements,Descriptive,
CRZ01,,Coral Reef Zone,Back Reef,Area between the seaward edge of a lagoon floor and the landward edge of a reef crest. This zone is present only when a reef crest exists.
CRZ02,,,Bank/Shelf,"Deeper water area (usually > 30 meters) extending offshore from the seaward edge of the fore reef (or shoreline) to the beginning of the bank/shelf escarpment where the insular shelf drops off into deep, oceanic water."
CRZ03,,,Bank/Shelf Escarpment,"The edge of the bank/shelf where depth increases rapidly into deep oceanic water. This zone begins at approximately 20-30 meters depth, near the depth limit of features visible in aerial images. This zone extends well into depths exceeding those that can be seen on aerial photos, and this zone is intended to capture the transition from the bank/shelf to deep waters of the open ocean."
CRZ04,,,Fore Reef,Area from the seaward edge of the reef crests (which slopes into deeper water) to the landward edge of the bank/shelf platform. Features not forming an emergent reef crest- but still having a seaward-facing slope that is significantly greater than the slope of the bank/shelf- are also designated as forereef.
CRZ05,,,Lagoon,"Shallow area (relative to the deeper water of the bank/shelf) between the shoreline intertidal zone and a back reef or barrier island. This zone is protected from the high-energy waves commonly experienced on the bank/shelf and reef crest. If no reef crest is present, there is no lagoon zone."
CRZ06,,,Reef Crest,"The flattened, emergent (especially during low tides) or nearly emergent segment of a reef. This zone lies between the back reef and fore reef zones. In aerial images, breaking waves will often be visible at the seaward edge of this zone."
CRZ07,,,Reef Flat,Shallow (semi-exposed) area between the shoreline intertidal zone and the reef crest of a fringing reef. This zone is protected from the high-energy waves commonly experienced on the shelf and reef crest. Reef flat is typically not present if there is a lagoon zone.
CRZ08,,,Ridges and Swales,"An area of numerous thin, narrow, discontinuous bands of coral ridges and leeward sand- and sediment-filled swales. Debris and reef-rubble fields behind many of the reefs may obscure these margin-parallel seabed features. In Florida, for example, this zone extends for an estimated 200 kilometers along the Florida shelf (from Key Largo to Halfmoon Shoal), and it is discontinuous due to (a) topography, (b) inconsistent responses of coral reefs to changing sea levels, and (c) varying effects of the physical environment on reefs and sediments."
CRZ09,,,Shoreline/Intertidal,Area between the mean high water line (or the landward edge of emergent vegetation- such as Red Mangrove- when present) and the lowest spring tide level (excluding emergent segments of barrier reefs).
CRZ10,,,Vertical Wall,"Area with near-vertical slope from the shore to the shelf (or shelf escarpment). This zone is typically narrow and may not be distinguishable in remotely gathered imagery; however, it is included because it is recognized as a biologically important feature."
